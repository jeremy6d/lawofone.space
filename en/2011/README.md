> Jim: The question this week is how does the concept of service vary or differ if it is offered in time/space as opposed to being offered in space/time? How does experience in general differ from time/space to space/time?

> Jim: The question this evening is from T in Taiwan. “Q’uo, please tell us something about the seeking and the enlightenment of Gautama Siddhartha, aka, the Buddha. What does this story tell us about spiritual enlightenment?

> Jim: The question this evening has to do with creativity. We were wondering in general how a creative outlet can help a seeker in mind, body and spirit, enhancing the experience of the incarnation in learning [and service] and maybe a little bit more information on how this creative energy that flows through us might be similar to the creative energy of the one Creator in making the Creation, including us.

> Jim: The question this evening comes from T in Taiwan. “Q’uo, we in Southeast Asia would appreciate your perspective on the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan along with the subsequent nuclear crisis. How does this event fit into the context of harvest and planetary transition? What can we do to be of aid to those affected by the tragedy?”

> Jim: The question this evening has to do with surrender. Besides information in general on the topic of surrender, we would like some information on the type of surrender that is desired, the mental surrender where one wishes to surrender but really hasn’t done it yet, and then some information on the surrender, shall we say, of the heart where the surrender has been made and then there is acceptance of that surrender.

> Jim: It seems that our purpose here is to assist in the birthing of fourth density. Now that it seems to be done, what will our purpose here be in a dying, third-density Earth, apart from the younger people cleaning up and healing the planet? What are we to get excited about from now until the end of our incarnation is here? What should we focus on during the remainder of third density?

> Jim: The question tonight, Q’uo, has to do with the synchronicities that many people in the circle have felt, of experiencing the number 11:11, on a repeated basis, feeling that there is some sort of message here. Could you give us information as to what the significance of seeing 11:11 might be to the individual, or seeing any type of repeated number like that? It doesn’t necessarily have to be 11:11 but we’d like to focus on that.

> Jim: The question this evening has to do with the topic of ascension. Most of us think of ascension in terms of what will happen to us after we die. We know that we drop the physical body and retain our spiritual or soul body. We walk the steps of light and continue forth into a new experience in that way. We would like some information tonight on the type of ascension that, say, Jesus did, or certain masters of all religions have done. I think Ra spoke of the 150 souls who were graduated after the second cycle. They could either go on to fourth density, if they wished, or stay, as they all chose to do, because they wished to see all of their brothers and sisters, shall we say, ascend or graduate with them. So we would like to know something about this type of ascension in which certain masters of all cultures throughout the ages have participated.

> Jim: The question this evening has to do with the concept of angels. We would like to ask just what angels are and how we can interact with them. Are they different from or similar to guides?

> Jim: The question this evening has to do with self-confidence. Could you give us some information, Q’uo, on how we can enhance or strengthen our self-confidence without becoming overly prideful? And then could you relate the self-confidence that we use in our daily activities to the faith that is really the [basis] for our metaphysical journeys?

## [January 22, 2011, Saturday Meditation](en/2011/2011_0122)


> Jim: The question this evening has to do with this: when we as seekers pray that the will of the Creator or of Jesus be done through us, how do we do this most effectively and to what power are we giving over our will? What exactly is occurring here and how does this affect our free will as seekers.

> Jim: We are wondering about the relationship we have with our higher self—how the higher self is formed; how it communicates with us; how it decides what information or assistance to give and what not to give. Just in general, what is the dynamic relationship and how does it function between ourselves here in third density and our higher selves at mid-sixth density?
