<p>I am Hatonn, and I greet you in the love and in the light of our infinite Creator. We thank you for allowing us to speak with you this evening and we use this time to tell a story and to test a point or two that may aid you in your thinking at this time.</p>
<p>Once there was a man who wished to build a fence of bricks. This man was a proud man and he wished his wall to be perfect. It was with exquisite care that he laid the plumb line and found the perfect horizontal level. The man was happy as he took fastidious care to begin his task rightly. The sun shone down upon him until he was very warm, yet he welcomed the sun. Indeed, the entity welcomed the chance to do the work that was necessary in order to begin to build his wall.</p>
<p>We shall transfer.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(L channeling)</p>
<p>I am Hatonn. I am now with this instrument. We shall continue. The entity of whom we spoke welcomed the labors necessary for the construction of his wall for he welcomed the opportunity to place his efforts in attunement with the pace of the universe he was able to sense in operation surrounding him, for just as the plumb line was true and the level a perfect one, so also did the universe about him operate with perfection. And as the subject of our tale perceived this state and moved in harmony within it, he felt the joy one feels when one becomes aware of the Godness within one’s own efforts. The act of creation in progress constantly about the entity was reflected in his own efforts to create this wall. And as his efforts were directed truly and accurately toward the completion of this perfect wall, so also did his contentment grow and his sense of fulfillment in this manifestation of that force he could feel about himself.</p>
<p>Upon its completion, another entity spoke to him in regards to his efforts, questioning the value of a wall, an object often used to shut other selves out. His contentment remained undisturbed. His reply was that the perfection lay within the object he had created and that it would remain perfect regardless of the efforts another might make to corrupt that perfection through misuse.</p>
<p>My friends, we often perceive about us our brothers and sisters engaged in actions which we may not understand or may preconceive a value for, and it is difficult to avoid attributing our predeveloped prejudices to individuals or the works they originate which remind us of what has occurred or what we have perceived within our own past experiences.</p>
<p>My brothers and my sister, a wall is but a wall. An act of creation is simply an act of creation which may be used as a tool towards selflessness or selfishness, and it is not always easy to perceive the intention which was in the mind of its creator. Be cautious, my friends, that you might avoid misunderstanding the efforts of another through your perceptions of similar efforts on the parts of those who have gone before, for it is within the heart of the builder, not the hands, that the potential value may grow.</p>
<p>At this time we will transfer to another instrument. I am Hatonn.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>I am Hatonn. We shall continue. Relationships with others might be likened to walls but even more we draw the simile of the wall to speak about yourselves. An attempt to come into right relationship with another is an attempt to cross walls on many levels of this meaning. The first wall which must be true is the structure of your own being. Perhaps your basic character is excellent, the lines true and straight, yet they have become dilapidated, bricks or stones missing, mortar failing. Therefore, when one is contemplating the experiences which arise within a relationship, it is well to begin the contemplation with an objective gaze inwardly directed at the structure of the self. If the base is not perfectly horizontal, if it is not quite plumb, then all will seem out of tune, out of order, shaky and fraught with difficulty.</p>
<p>Therefore, we suggest that you use meditation and contemplation to build yourself as inspiration gives you one piece of knowledge and then another and another as you move along the pathway of discovery.</p>
<p>When you gaze beyond your own wall of being, beyond your own structure at another, it is well to remember that there is only one builder for each being that exists; that builder is the being itself. Each entity is created uniquely, first male or female, then an incredible variety of other polarities. All these pieces of structure are placed together to build the skeletal being through which consciousness is manifested.</p>
<p>How shall two walls which are fixed relate to each other? My friends, it is time to release the allegory and gaze at an illusion which may illuminate the denser illusion in which you now enjoy existence. The walls that you build within yourself are energy fields. Therefore, they are moveable and must move with you wherever you go. The stance which you take, the wall which you choose to use, behind which you choose to hide within a relationship with another, is that which must be observed, analyzed and balanced in such a way that the wall again becomes an energy field which is permeable so that two walls may …</p>

<p>… this group once again and we do so in joy. We thank you and we ask if we might attempt to answer a query or two this evening?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Okay. I have a student who has begun to channel very well. She has no experience and yet it is very difficult for her to come here and gain the experience, technically speaking. When she is properly tuned she is perfectly able to channel. She is very concerned about her ability to channel away from the protection of more experienced channels. I wonder if you could speak concerning her concern and where wisdom lies in my helping her in her work.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister. The new instrument of which you speak is one which has indeed begun to assimilate the process of becoming a vocal channel to a degree which is gratifying, and yet is at that point which must be tenderly cared for, for as the new instrument begins to utilize his desire to be of service and finds that service broadening, there is the constant tendency to wonder if that which is received is that which is transmitted. This is where the experience is most helpful to one which is in constant need of building the confidence. We feel that the entity of which you speak is one which is well aware of the tuning necessity and the joint necessity of challenging those contacts which it first feels after the tuning has been completed. This entity is one which has a surrounding of friends which can provide the few who would aid in completing the protection and tuning needs of new instruments, yet it might be well for this new instrument to experience further exercising of its expanding abilities before attempting to, shall we say, set out upon its own in this endeavor. Yet this potential is one which grows with this new instrument’s continued exercise.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Specifically, the entity known as S is unsure whether or not to practice with the support group before she comes here again. I’d like any advice you can give me on what to tell her.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister. As we have attempted to iterate in our previous response, this is a point in this new instrument’s development which is as the tender shoot which has just begun to move from the seed and is now seeking the light of day for the first time. There are potential difficulties for such a tender shoot as it moves into the light of day. We can suggest that this instrument is near the point in its development at which it would indeed be able to practice its abilities as a vocal instrument with those chosen about it in its, as you call it, distant location. We would not wish to rush this instrument’s progress, for though there is a great possibility that at this time it could practice upon its own with support, there is also a significant possibility that it could find difficulties which would, shall we say, set it back in its progress. Therefore, we cannot be specific in our suggestion, for the growth of the instrument is at a point that is difficult to accurately estimate.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Yes. I agree with you completely. That was my feeling, too.</p>
<p>My feeling further was that as S and I had talked of before, perhaps you could spend not just two days but plan ahead, come as on vacation, possibly even with family, and work for a period of five to seven days, and this week—say of two meditations a day—would put her over the edge safely as far as being able to pick up vibrations and so forth. Could you confirm that?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister, and we can suggest that this potential plan is one which would be far more liable to present this new instrument with a firm foundation upon which it shall offer its services as a vocal instrument.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> No, thank you.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we thank you, my sister, as always. May we attempt another query at this time?</p>
<p><strong>L:</strong> Latwii, would you speak some on the nature of competition? I recognize it in some ways as being a very beneficial way of sharing in the nature of the camaraderie involved between those who participate as opposed to those who are destined to be winner or loser. At the same time, there seems to be such an abuse of competition within our world that I’d be interested in hearing whatever you have to say on the subject.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my brother. We may take this topic and look upon it as a means whereby an individual or group of individuals may seek to develop those skills which lie within in order to express a certain potential, shall we say, much as your young kittens roll and tumble about upon the rug as they seek to express that which is within their physical energy systems. The entities who partake in your competitive games and sport activities are those of the, shall we say, childlike nature who seek to discover the limits to which the self can be put and the fruits of putting themselves to those limits. As these discoveries and fruits are harvested, then there is the choice that the individual and the group of individuals can make. This choice is of the basic nature which is, shall we say, the nature of your illusion itself. That is, shall the abilities of an entity be used to aid and enjoy others or shall these abilities be used to aid and bring pleasure to the self?</p>
<p>When entities utilize the abilities in the manner which lends to the enjoyment of many, then it is as if the gift of the one Creator in its unique form for each entity has been radiated out from this entity to those about it, and the general mirth and pleasure and enhanced experience of the group then is the final result of this testing of self. When the entity or group, however, then decides that the abilities of the group shall be pitted against another group or an entity decides this for itself and shall then pit its abilities against another in order to best or defeat that group or other self, then we have the attempt to gather for the self or group those gifts not only given to the self but those abilities and attentions and recognitions of others as well.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of the service-to-self polarity but is seldom, shall we say, pursued in perfect purity, for there is much within your competitive sports which swings to and fro, back and forth between the poles of radiance and magnetism or positivity and negativity. Therefore, my brother, you have the tool of what you have called competition which may be used as may any tool to serve self or serve others.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my brother?</p>
<p><strong>L:</strong> No, that’s been a great help. I compliment you on your analogy …</p>
<p class="comment">(Side one of tape ends.)</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Jim channeling)</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am once again with this instrument. May we attempt another query at this time?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> One more and then we’ll quit. I understand that anger often produces cancer in people. I was contemplating what brings about the heart trouble? If it can be associated with certain emotions? Is it as simple as heartbreak or sorrow?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister. Though generalities are frequently our lot in attempting to answer your queries, they are quite often not specifically accurate in all instances, for there are anomalies in all general rules. As you look to the disease that any entity may be experiencing, one may look to the nature of the disease, the effect of the disease upon the entity. Frequently it is also possible to look to the location of the difficulty within an entity and be able to place this difficulty with its corresponding energy center, then discovering the nature of the energy blockage according to the energy center involved.</p>
<p>In the case of the difficulties with the heart, one of the two primary organs within the human being as you know it, one deals with a portion of the physical vehicle which has analogous and extensive relationships with each of the various energy centers, for this organ does by its functioning provide the entire physical vehicle with the nutrients that are carried by the bloodstream, as it is called. This organ, then, is that which in the physical sense enlivens the entire physical vehicle and circulates the essence of that vehicle throughout its system of transport, shall we say. An entity who feels the difficulty or disease which is located within the heart is an entity who in many cases has blocked the ability of the finer body or energy center’s heart in its action of providing a life-sustaining and life-enhancing energy or essence not only to the self but perhaps to other selves as well.</p>
<p>As you look upon the energy center which has the closest correlation to the physical organ of the heart, the green ray energy center then is brought into focus in it’s function of providing the unconditional love and support that is the building block, shall we say, or life-sustaining force throughout all of creation. When a portion of this force has been activated within an entity and then upon a subsequent occasion been blocked in some degree, there may be an expression of this blockage within the physical organ of the heart. The variety of kinds of blockages is so great as to be quite beyond our ability to enumerate with any hope of completion. We can suggest that as we have mentioned, the function of the physical heart in providing the entire vehicle sustenance is analogous to the green energy center and its providing of the unconditional love and creative force which underlies all of creation.</p>
<p>May we attempt a further response, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> No, thank you.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we thank you, my sister. We must apologize for our response which was quite lengthy and yet was not able to be as specific as perhaps you had hoped. May we attempt another query at this time?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Well, since you’ve said that, I’ll tell you the reason I hesitated. It was not because I didn’t think that you were very clear; I did. I realized that you have to take all generalizations with a good deal of grains of salt. I was going to go into the somewhat baroque question of the mechanical things that people will tell you will hurt the heart, the cholesterol, the plaque and smoking, various things like that, and decided not to because—I realized when I thought about it that actually those behaviors, the ways of eating, the way one feels about one’s body, is probably tied in, just as you said, with a grain of salt, with the feeling one has about oneself as a person who offers love. So I didn’t ask the question, but I thought that you were very specific, as specific as I would expect you could be. Thank you.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we thank you, my sister. We can make the additional general comment that when an entity is engaging in those patterns of thought which tend to block any of the various energy centers, whatever means is available to that entity that will allow the expression of this blockage when it has not been noticed by the mental process of analysis will then be utilized. Those which are of the scientist’s career have noted the similarity of certain of your cultural habits and customs which are closely related to certain dysfunctions, yet in many cases these are not available to an individual, and yet other means must be found to produce the symbolic disease of the physical vehicle in order that the mental complex might then take note and more efficiently use that catalyst which was not well used when first presented to the entity.</p>
<p>May we answer further of this query or another query?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we find that we have for the moment exhausted those queries which have so graciously been placed before us this evening. We thank you each, my friends, for your graciousness in once again extending to us the invitation to join your seeking of the truth this evening. We, as humble messengers and pilgrims upon that one and the same path, are gratified to be able to join you, and remind each of you that it is only because we have traveled a bit further upon that path that we attempt to aid you upon your journey. We have no hard, shall we say, and fast rules which must obeyed or even listened to. Take that then which has the value to you for your own consideration. Leave that then which has no value in your considerations. We shall leave this group at this time and return upon your request. In the love and the light then, we leave you and thank you and bless you. We are those of Latwii. Adonai. Adonai, my friends.</p>
