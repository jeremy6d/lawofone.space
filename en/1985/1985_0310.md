<p>I am Hatonn, and I greet you, my friends, in the love and in the light of our infinite Creator. It is a great privilege to be with you this evening. We come to serve and we do our humble best but, as always, we ask you to discard and leave all that may be found unworthy.</p>
<p>Each of you has seen the picture of a drop of water which is then placed under ten times magnification and then fifty times magnification and so on until we are looking at the very nucleus of [it] and [the] surrounding electrons. You know, my friends, that each time you looked something had changed to that drop of water, something that was outside of that drop of water’s control. Scientists surrender to their technical informational equipment. It is left to those of the path to surrender in another way and that is to welcome, accept and encourage spiritual growth and change in themselves and others. What one may see as a drop of water, another may see ten times magnified and so forth. Each is looking at the same universe, caught whole and perfect in a microscope’s eye.</p>
<p>This is true, also, my friends, of you in your relationship with yourself, with the Creator, and with others. You must first be able to accept and like yourself in order to serve the one Creator with the most efficacious effect. One entity then may need one thing, another another, but it is all the same experience, seen from different points of view. We are all studying, working, learning and teaching. Yes, my friends, even you who are within third density have sometimes volunteered, as apples often do, to be of service in the subconscious of another entity. Getting to know yourself begins with meditation, is challenged by your creative responses to situations, and your future is melded from the manifestations of your inner seeking. Let us say for now that each instrument has found a balance that then he may then go forward to gaze upon the Creator, to experience love for that great Logos which made us, the intimate and personal love of a true father in a true family. In this part of your attempt at self-examination, we urge that time be taken at the end of the day, if possible, to jot down those things which you found profitable and those things which you found difficult or harmful. Soon you will begin to detect a pattern. The pattern is the pattern of your manifestation which comes through your being from the great levels and touches the people about you.</p>
<p>We see that the harsh winds of summer have blown your streets clear of snow and we are aware that each has a somewhat more buoyant attitude towards this incarnation than <em>(inaudible)</em> its surprises during a period of this sort of weather than when the weather is dark and gloomy by its very nature …</p>
<p>We should at this point transfer from this contact. I am Hatonn.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Jim channeling)</p>
<p>I am Hatonn, and greet you through this instrument in love and light. We appreciate the service of the one known as Carla, though her condition is somewhat marginal. We thank her for offering all she has in this service. To continue with our thought.</p>
<p>As your season moves from that which was the cold, windswept, barren and introspected into that season which begins the warming and nourishing of that which was the focus of the introspection, winter, there is a lightening the hearts, a gladdening and a sparkle, shall we say, to the mind’s eye. This we see among your people at this time and it is in your experience likened unto a magnification of the life pattern which surrounds you and through which you move at this time. The tendency of the winter season is to turn the eye inward that those portions of the self which have exercised their luxuriant summer’s growth, shall we say, might then be observed and considered for their harvest of that season that this harvest then might then be the foundation of yet another season’s cycle of growth.</p>
<p>It is always a joy to reap the harvest and then to consider the sowing for the new year, the new year for the growth of the spirit in your manifestation. You will move through this new season of growth, each in your own fashion, watering those planted ideas, thoughts and tendencies that you feel have value in your continued journey. You shall also, according to your own discrimination pluck those growths that seem as weeds and seem to hinder that spiritual journey which now finds a new level of realization within your life. As you use your discrimination to evaluate the experiences which are placed before you and which you find yourself moving within, you must ever keep before your mind’s eye the purposes as you understand them for your movement and your growth, for many are the plants and forms of life within your garden of experience.</p>
<p>From one particular point of view, or shall we say power of magnification, a certain experience may seem very difficult and quite undesirable. It may indeed seem as the weed that needs the plucking and the removal from the garden of your experience. And yet, if you look deeper, my friends, and magnify your own perceptions inwardly and outwardly, you discover within that situation which seemed most difficult and undesirable the possibility of a great acceleration in your spiritual journey. For as you move through your illusion, the strength of spirit which is possible for you to gain is most often that which is gained not with the ease of a feast table, plainly and easily set, but oftentimes is that experience which provides the most difficulty in surviving and evaluating for its value. The experiences which of necessity cause you to reach deeper within your own being in order to find means of achieving harmony with self and other self are those experiences which, as the sandpaper to the roughened board, smooth the spiritual journey in a very real and basic sense.</p>
<p>For as you move through your illusion, you shall discover that those times in which there was an ease of being and expression and perhaps a happy contentment to go with them, there was less of that harvested of the spiritual nature, shall we say. Those experiences, on the other hand, which were very difficult at the time they appeared within one’s life may have provided one with the spiritual challenge that then yielded the harvest that was unrecognized at the time, yet at a later time, as you call it, became apparent to the inward-seeking eye.</p>
<p>We cannot with any surety describe to you any particular set of circumstances which might be productive of this type of spiritual growth, for within each life pattern there is a unique potential for realizing such growth. Yet we can say to you that things are not always as they seem within one’s life. This is especially true for the seeker of what you call truth, for in the metaphysical sense, it is very difficult for one to determine one’s own progress and one’s own means of achieving this progress. You move within an illusion which …</p>

<p>… moving in perfect harmony with the cycles and seasons and the rhythms of being. We shall leave you now, in an illusory sense only, for in truth we are always with you and always one. We are those of Hatonn. Adonai, my friends. Adonai vasu borragus.</p>

<p>I am Latwii, and we greet you also, my friends, in the love and the light of our infinite Creator. We are happy to tread where those of Hatonn have left their footprints as well, and we offer our humble service in the same manner, asking that you take that which we give with, shall we say, your proverbial grain of salt. We are happy to offer ourselves in the attempt of answering your queries and we would ask at this time if there might be a query with which we might begin?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Latwii, is there anything that I can do to help R that I have not already attempted?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and, my sister, we find that your efforts in this matter have been most exemplary. The most important portion of these efforts, as we have mentioned before, is that intention with which you begin and continue your workings. The desire which you manifest in these workings is that motivating force which many have called love and we can find no better word for this facet and function of experience that you now seek to express in order that another might find a greater balance within its own being. We suggest that you continue upon that path which you have firmly planted your feet upon.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> No, thank you Latwii.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we thank you, my sister. Is there another query?</p>
<p class="comment">(Pause)</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we find that each person has taken one step backwards and left this volunteer to end. We do indeed end our stay with you with much reluctance but we glory in each of your beautiful colors, the vibrations of your being and the energy fields that they have created. How beautiful you are, my friends. We are those of Latwii. We bid farewell in the love and the light of the one infinite Creator. We realize that there are some who would wish that we could walk among you, but that is not a safe thing to do, and so we speak to you, and so we are always available to you. We bid you farewell. Adonai. Adonai.</p>
