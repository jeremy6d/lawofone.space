<p>I am Hatonn. I greet you, my friends, in the love and in the light of our infinite Creator. It is a great pleasure to speak with you this evening. We especially welcome the opportunity to continue the training of the new instrument known as S. You may notice that we almost always refer to entities respecting the fact that the name of the entity is not the entity but merely an artificial label by which your peoples categorize each other. One of the greatest differences betwixt third density and that kingdom which many are about to inherit which we call fourth density is that the labeling on an artificial level becomes unnecessary, thereby freeing entities from the many false vibrations which are thrown out about each entity which is misnamed.</p>
<p>We wish to tell you a parable, a little story. Once upon a time there was an old man who with his trusty walking stick was making his way through the cobblestones of the village in which he had lived and his father before him and his father before him. This man had married and yet his wife had died, and in dying had lost their only unborn child. More than years bent the old man’s back as he picked his way along the cobblestones.</p>

<p>The instrument is feeling our vibration but is extremely nervous this evening due to a thought process that she has been going through, one in which she does not feel that she is able to actually serve as an instrument, is afraid to be wrong. Let us assure her that these doubts are a normal process that each new instrument goes through, not to analyze or try to sense ahead in the story or be afraid that it is her imagination and not our words.</p>
<p>The old man felt very lonely and desolate. He wandered through the town and saw many familiar faces, for as he grew up in that town, it was a small town, a small village in which he knew each and every person, their children by name. In the past he had always attained great comfort in this village but today he felt alone. He felt he had lost his only life in the loss of his great love, his wife and the baby he had yet to meet but yet loved with all his heart.</p>

<p class="channel-type">(Jim channeling)</p>
<p>On this day as the old man wandered through the village, his burden of grief and concern brought into his mind a new idea. And upon this idea, this inspiration, he decided to act. With but a few possessions and his trusted walking stick, he set out of the village and began to make a journey over a nearby pass of mountains and wandered for as far as his legs would carry him for the first day. As he journeyed, he felt a certain peace within, and though he knew not his final destination, there was a small measure of comfort that he took as he journeyed.</p>

<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>Soon the sun grew low in the west and he made camp and rested. And is <em>(inaudible)</em> a procession of days and nights the old man journeyed far until he was so many miles from his village that no one ever had heard of him. No one knew the man with the walking stick, and at first the old man was lonelier than ever and wished that he had not forsaken his home. Here he felt no one would love him. Here he felt no one would pick him up should he fall, tend him if he grew ill, wipe away his tears, and though love whispered in the trees, murmured along the grasses, his ear did not hear nor did his eyes see until the day when he indeed did become very ill as his heart failed him, and he went to his knees upon the dusty trail just outside another small and unknown village.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(S channeling)</p>
<p>He lay on the ground feeling very much alone, though surrounded by trees and the sky and the flowers nearby. He felt that he was alone in the universe. As the old man lay there with his walking stick nearby, some children passing came upon him. One knelt down to wipe the hair from his brow while another ran home for help. The man lay there wondering, “How can these children help me?” and yet received tremendous love and comfort in the light, cool touch of this little child’s caring hand. Before long, he awoke to find himself in a bed in a room full of people who, though [they] had strange faces, had very familiar eyes. The eyes of these people in this small town were the same eyes that he had loved in the town behind. Women served him broth, a man built a fire, children laughed in the other room. Although he knew not their names, nor where he was, he recognized the same sounds, the sameness of people and the caring in these people in this new village.</p>

<p class="channel-type">(Jim channeling)</p>
<p>As he lay upon the bed, many thoughts passed through the old man’s mind. He began to think on the times that he had spent in his home village with his wife and how they had hoped for such a long time to have a family of their own. He treasured these memories and thought much about the feelings that he and his wife had shared. Now as he looked about him, he saw many new faces, yet the eyes and the caring were old and familiar as friends, and he thought to himself that there must be some meaning here, for he had just undertaken a long journey through unfamiliar terrain and had nearly seen his life pass before his eyes. And now there was about him a great expression of love and compassion. The old man knew that there was here a caring which was like unto that that he had known with his wife and friends, that could not be changed by location or time and somehow this gave him hope. He looked then into other portions of his life and those things that he desired and had felt would never be his to see if there was perhaps a wider opportunity for these to also be a portion of his new discoveries.</p>

<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>As he pondered and as he recovered, he found himself quite often in the company of one particular young man. This young man was drawn to the traveler, and together they spoke of many things and shared many thoughts. The old man discovered that his young friend was only six months younger than his own child would have been had his wife borne him and the young man became more and more enamored of the traveler. They spoke of his falling and the miracle the old man felt had happened when small children were able to mobilize a village in aid of a stranger.</p>
<p>We shall transfer.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(S channeling)</p>
<p>The young man had been dissatisfied with his life in a small town, had been dreaming of traveling to a new and exciting larger village in which to find the happiness that he was seeking. By sharing and talking with this traveler he began to realize the experiences of this old traveler were ones where he could learn from, that the larger town that he had been dreaming of did not have the answer, was no different, would hold the same eyes as the town in which he was presently living. And through the eyes of his friend, the old traveler, he began to see his own village, though tiny, with a new sense, a new awareness. He felt the kindness and the love that had banded together to help the old man. He heard the laughter of the children through new ears. He saw the young girls through a new heart and realized the happiness that he was seeking could be found in the small village in which he lived. He need not venture on a long journey as the traveler had done, for he took that long journey through his sharing in the awarenesses gained through his friend.</p>
<p>This story is one that applies everywhere. Though you may travel from city to city, from mountains to sea looking and searching as the old traveler did for the answers to your loneliness, you may wish before venturing out to choose to listen to the children outside your window, to see the eyes of your neighbors and feel the hearts of your friends. The answers, my brothers and sisters, may be in your own back yard.</p>

<p class="channel-type">(Jim channeling)</p>
<p>Your journeys, whether you ever move in the geographical sense or not, shall be long, and shall have included the great heights that one attains from time to time and the ability to see in the distant past as from the top of the mountain and to discern those portions of your learning which have been well done. You may look into what you call your future and see many possibilities for continuing this journey. And as you continue it, you will find from time to time that there are valleys and vales and turns in your trail which take you in places that are not so easily discerned. You will have your doubts as to which fork in the road to take. You will feel the gains and the losses and a burden with memory, yet still you shall push on, for within the heart of each of you, my friends, is the strong and thirsty seeker which yearns for that which it does not have, or so it seems.</p>
<p>And though you shall move within your mind to many points of viewing, when you sum your journey at any point, you will find that within it is contained the whole of that which you have sought. You are that which you seek; you are the trail that you travel; you are the seeker that yearns; and you hide from yourself the mysteries of your being that you may unfold them when the time of your journey is right. Like the old man, you have your trusted walking stick, those cherished beliefs that carry you onward and steady you from time to time as the trail becomes treacherous. And yet as the walking stick serves well for a time, it frequently must be replaced for the wear and tear of the journey beats hard upon the seeker and its beliefs. Yet that heart of the seeker remains strong in seeking and is that which sustains the seeker’s journey.</p>
<p>We shall transfer.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>And whenever that heart fails because of overwhelming circumstances, and you, like the old man, find yourself upon the ground, never fear, for the wind shall tell the sky; the sky shall whisper it to the trees; the trees shall murmur to the birds, the raven, the hawk, the sparrow. And one special bird shall bespeak a small child, a child who prattles as he plays, yet the child shall run to see that of which the bird speaks, and shall then go and receive the aid abundant, running over that [which] is needed. Therefore, be ye of light heart amidst the complexities of the dark world. There is no moment which does not contain all that is needed, all that is good, all that is beautiful, and all that is true. Even if you cry, let your tears be a benediction as you acknowledge the frailty of this illusion and the enormous power of love that shall lift up all that is broken. And if you so desire, make all whole.</p>
<p>Should we ask then for names? Or shall we use one name for all the eyes in all the entities which we see …</p>

<p>We shall leave this instrument at this time, with many thanks to each instrument for the privilege of working with each. We leave you in love and in the light of One Who Is beyond name, beyond identification, in the love and in the light of One Who Is all that there is. We leave you in the infinite love and the omnipresent light of the one Creator. We are known to you by the name Hatonn. Adonai. Adonai.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Jim channeling)</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we greet you, my friends, in the love and the light of that same Creator. We wear our name quite proudly in your little group, and are happy to offer our humble service if we may attempt to answer your queries at this time. May we then begin?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Latwii, do you have any suggestions as to how I could be a better servant in this process as an instrument?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister. Well, now, the subject is one which we could speak at length on but we feel that there is a short [answer] which is most appropriate. That is to persevere, my sister. It is not that difficult to become an instrument, as you are well aware. What is most difficult is to become a foolish instrument, that is, one which is willing to step out upon the limb not knowing whether there shall be another portion to support the stepping again. If you can in your own mind and heart, then, learn to step fearlessly out with no assurance that there shall be support, you shall be developing that ability of surrender which is most helpful in this type of service.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Latwii, I live very far from here, and it is very difficult to come here in which to train. I have support and love where I come from but I do want to do the right way and the right tuning to receive your messages of love and light. Is there anything that I can do to speed this process? I have very little patience.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister. Well, this is the usual case for the seeker. Seekers begin with a great desire and very little patience, and when the seeker is the adept it has then great patience and very little desire. Upon this journey and this balancing we can continually recommend a healthy dose of patience but can also suggest that as your abilities in this area proceed, you may be able to find those very close and trusted friends in your own geographical location with which you may practice this particular skill after a certain amount of its refinement has occurred to your own satisfaction.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Thank you, Latwii. I have a question on another subject, and that is the level or density of what is referred to as personal guides, our spirit guides, those inner plane teachers. Can you speak to that?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister. Ah yes, indeed, we may speak to this subject, for again it is one which has a great range of possibilities. One’s seeking in one’s incarnation is that which attracts to the self those friends and, as you have called them, guides and angelic presences which attempt to serve as a result of the call or seeking of the entity involved. This call or seeking, therefore, can be of an infinite variety of possibility. There are many entities who can and do respond to such seeking. They may be of your own planetary influence, and may be those who have as yourself incarnated a number times upon a certain planetary influence and who between the, shall we say, incarnations, serve as the guide now with a wider perspective. There are guides and friends also attracted from influences and density levels, thus you have at your disposal, according to your seeking, entities of a great variety of sources, yet all are the one Creator in certain distortions or frequencies, seeking to be of service to the One.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> I think you covered it. I was specifically asking for those guides that are with us from birth until death, knowing that we have the ability also to access higher teachers. It is a question that has come up many times in my work as sharing information under a course of Free Soul. Thank you.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we thank you, my sister. Is there another question?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> How am I doing as a beginner? Is there anything that you can—a fine point that you can give me, a help to better this process?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister. At this point we feel that your progress is that which is to be commended. We cannot suggest fine points at this time, for at this time the basic process of becoming the fool, the one who opens the self to another with the tuning completed is that process which you have undertaken and undertaken well.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> I guess it’s the old story of practice, practice, practice. Thank you.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we thank you, my sister. May we attempt another query?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> When Hatonn first came in I felt that Hatonn, those of Hatonn, were trying to open through me. And yet I was struggling with calling it my imagination. Can you speak to that?</p>
<p>I am Latwii and am aware of your query, my sister. And we note that you are correct upon both assumptions.</p>
<p>May we answer you further?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> No. Thanks.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we again thank you. May we attempt another query at this time?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> There was a dizziness that both Carla and I experienced upon landing in Atlanta, a lightheartedness, a nausea, and a dizziness. Can you give us information on that?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister. Upon this particular topic we feel there is no need to discuss in great detail those transient phenomena which can frequently assail the traveler who has moved a great distance in a confined space, and which has felt the accompanying discomfort.</p>
<p>May we attempt further response, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Then you’re ruling out all possibility of negative entities’ energizing the problem?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister. We have not ruled out such a possibility, for indeed it always exists but at this point we feel that each of you, my sisters, have enough experience with such that there need not be any over-concentration upon these phenomena.</p>
<p>May we attempt further response, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> My hand got very bad very fast some short time after that, and S virtually burned her own skin trying to help me get through that pain. Is it important to judge whether there is a negative entity energizing in such an occurrence?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister. We feel that the importance in such a case after the recognition of the possibility of what is occurring lies more in the loving of the entity and the finding of the perfection in the moment, no matter what the moment.</p>
<p>May we attempt further response, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Yes, just one more. S and I both felt that what we needed to do was to interpret the pain, and when I thought back over the day, the only thing that I’d done during the day was to move a rolling cart that only took the pressure of one finger to move. Nevertheless, had anyone been with me I would not have been willing to do it. I therefore took it as a sign and a warning that I needed to continue to limit myself and accept my limitations, and, indeed, limit myself more than I had been. Can you verify this process of thinking?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister. We feel that your ability to analyze such a situation is quite well refined and is of the utmost importance in this particular situation. Therefore, we cannot speak specifically, for your own choices are of paramount importance as you consider the ramifications of your limitations and what is the most appropriate response to them.</p>
<p>May we attempt further response, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we thank you, my sister. Is there another query at this time?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> In attempting to help dissipate the pain, I had an intense burning of my palm. Was I holding too long or too close?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister. We may suggest in general when one attempts to serve as that known as the healer that the most efficient kind of, shall we say, healing catalyst is that which moves through the healer and does not use the healer’s own energies, for each entity within your illusion is of a finite nature and that which available to each entity is of an infinite nature, and is therefore more able to serve as the healing catalyst.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> I attempted to visualize a healing energy passing from the spiritual universe through me and actively trying to not give of my energy but just to be an instrument in which to focus energy through. I guess I failed if I’m interpreting what you said correctly. I was giving my energy rather than passing the energy through which was my intent. Although I did not feel drained.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we feel that within your comment there is the query. If we have mistaken the query, please re-question. We may suggest that your great caring for the one known as Carla created a concern that your were responsible for this entity, and the desire to aid the entity in the healing of the hand then did carry a portion of this personal desire.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> No, thank you.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we thank you, my sister, and may make final comment in the respect of those who would serve as healers, and that is that the healer asks that the will of the one Creator be done. The healer then has no will.</p>
<p>May we attempt another query at this time?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Thank you, Latwii. A question came up the other night of sending healing love or healing energy to another person. I have been sending to those what you call guides of that person, who I feel are far better at—able to discern how much should be passed through to the person. Others have said they send it directly to the person in need. Can you speak on the two?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister, and we can speak by asking if you write a letter to a friend, you may give it to the friend or give it to a friend of the friend who will give it to the friend, and when the letter is read by the friend, the friend will take from the letter what it will. Therefore, the message delivered is the same message—that which the friend receives is what the friend chooses. Therefore, we may suggest that it matters not.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> I guess I was concerned with infringing, sending energy not requested even though I was aware of someone being ill. But I think the previous statement of the will of the Creator being the utmost and just offering light is the true bottom line. Thank you.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we thank you again, my sister. Is there another query at this time?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Just a check, a little reality check. Basically, then, the metaphysics of the situation are that the incarnational personality is the boss of the higher self. The higher self does not protect the self, it is rather a resource of the self, and is used by intention. Is that what you’re intimating?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister. We have a somewhat new facet to this query, now we have introduced the higher self. Now this portion of the small self, shall we say, does indeed guide and protect when possible, yet at most times is that which is the resource for the entity within the incarnation. The entity’s free will is that which is of paramount importance at all times, and is that which will determine whether the entity accepts guidance and protection from any other source, be it the higher self, inner plane guides, or earthly friends who may attempt assistance in any of an infinite number of forms.</p>
<p>This free will is frequently exercised upon a subconscious basis, we may add, therefore the entity may seek healing for a situation which has still some lesson to teach which has not been consciously learned. Therefore, the entity will consciously see the healing yet its subconscious mind shall continue the configuration of the disease until the lesson has been learned. Therefore, the free will is exercised subconsciously in part and in part consciously. The free will in its total exercise will be that factor which determines how much the entity shall accept from whatever source.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> No, thank you, I’m through. It’s nice to talk to you.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we thank you, my sister. It is a joy to hear your voice as well. May we attempt another query at this time?</p>
<p class="comment">(Pause)</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we are very privileged to have been able to join this group this evening. It has been a great thrill for us to speak, and we thank each of you. We at this time shall leave this group and shall be happy to join each in meditations upon request. We are those of Latwii and we leave you now in the love and in the light of our infinite Creator. Adonai. Adonai, my friends.</p>
