<p>I am Hatonn. We would speak with you briefly before moving on to the, as this instrument calls it, intensive portion of the meeting, wishing only to greet you in the love and in the light of our infinite Creator and to explain that we aided the instrument somewhat in its choice of tuning. Each entity had a good deal of busyness to the day and there was much relaxation that would be fruitful for the adventure of attempting the vocal channeling. Indeed, the relaxation of the body is most important. It is often the case that one does not know how caught up in one’s very physical vehicle they have been in the daily round until one first sits down to relax. It is as if the physical vehicle does not communicate perfectly with the mind of the individual. This is unfortunate, my friends. There is much illness or disease among your peoples that could well be solved if entities were aware of their bodies all the time and responded appropriately when the need arose. We shall leave you at this time in the love and the light of our infinite Creator. We are known to you as those of Hatonn.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>I am Laitos, and I greet you, my friends, also in the love and in the light of the Creator Who Is All. We are aware that you seek us, yet we also are aware that in each mind there is the questioning. Therefore, we shall attempt to give a good balance between the working with each new instrument and the desire for answered questions. We would, as always when transferring to another instrument, wish to provide the basic information concerning who we are and in what guise we come. We shall pause.</p>
<p class="comment">(Pause)</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Let’s visualize all of this inside, the beautiful limitless white light, so that we can retune.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>We are those of Hatonn and Laitos. That portion speaking through this instrument is now Laitos but both energies are with this group at this time. Again we greet you in love and in light. We thank the one known as R for the attention to the quieting of the distracting noises. As this instrument would put it, we need all the help we can get. It is a joy to be with you and a joy to be working with each new instrument. We shall transfer now to the one known as J in order to exercise this instrument and say only a few simple thoughts. We ask the instrument not to analyze and to speak freely without attempting to analyze in any way that which is spoken, realizing that our concepts seem a good deal like one’s own thoughts. The difference is subtle and as one becomes more and more capable and vocal channeling becomes easier to spot, one is aware that one has not thought something, and yet it is there. That is the channeling as you know it.</p>
<p>We now attempt this process through the one known as J, and we leave this instrument. I am Laitos.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>May we comment that it is almost as difficult to get this instrument’s attention sometimes as it is to gain the attention of the one known as J, and this instrument has a habit of being a million miles away which is sometimes counterproductive. It is our joy to be working with the one known as J. We feel that we have good contact. However, we have not been able to fasten upon any single way of expressing subjectively to the one known as J that we are with this instrument. We shall be working on that detail. Meanwhile, we thank very much the one known as J and would move on to the one known as R. If this instrument would appreciate or desire the experience of the vocal contact, this is the time, my friends. Now is always the time. Later is almost never the time for what one wishes to do. Therefore, we would at this time transfer to the one known as R.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>I am again with this instrument. I am Laitos. We were able to get the feeling of conditioning with this instrument but the conditioning that is desired has not yet, shall we say, peaked. We shall continue working to substantially aid the instrument in feeling our presence and meanwhile we would go on to the one known as N and say to this instrument, you are not expected to do anything, or, if you wish, to say anything. These vocal contacts are services that may be performed for the benefit of others. It is one of an infinite array of ways to help another. There is no extreme rightness or cachet to the ability to channel nor is there any lack of service if one wishes to serve in other areas. To channel is not to be spiritual. There are times when to be spiritual is to desire to channel. We ask all of those who may see or hear these words to keep this in mind. Meanwhile, we shall rush upon our way to the unsuspecting next channel which is latent within the one known as N’s bosom and attempt to make some verbal communication such as “I am Laitos” clear to this new instrument. We now transfer. I am Laitos.</p>
<p><strong>N:</strong> Laitos promised to turn up the volume but he didn’t turn it up.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(N channeling)</p>
<p>I greet you in the love and light and light love of the one infinite Creator. You are … I think I lost it.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>I am Laitos. I am again with this instrument, and again greet you in love and light. May we say to the one known as N that we are most exuberant to have made contact and appreciate that success and the dedication which it springs from. When a new instrument begins to speak, may we say to the one known as N, it is very frequently the case that the contact becomes lost because of analysis of the message or because of the distracting “rush,” as this instrument would call it, of feelings that accompany the contact.</p>
<p>In order to maintain contact under these conditions, there is a simple trick which one uses and that is to refrain from speaking in the first person. The one losing that fine tuned contact will be instructed as part of the package deal we are offering these days in communications. However, the instructions will be in the third person, as you are channeling about yourself in the third person and not as yourself. This has aided many a new instrument until the confidence is there to stride forward in a more authoritative way.</p>
<p>We would, before we close through this instrument, once again contact the one known as R. We transfer to this instrument at this time. I am Laitos.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(R channeling)</p>
<p>I am Laitos.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>I am Laitos, and once again elated to find that our signal is being picked up. We have a way to go in order to make this contact crystal clear. However, the simple knowing of our presence is very elating. We thank the one known as R, and again we would transfer to the one known as J. I am Laitos.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>I am Laitos. We had been so close to contact with the one known as J that we were reluctant to cease attempting it. But we feel that our time is about up. We have had a glorious time working with you and sharing incarnational vibrations with you. We thank each of you and as this instrument would say, all our rowdy friends are coming out tonight. <em>(Sound of a cat meowing.)</em> There are many of us, but we are as one, and within that love and that oneness you are always included, my friends, never more so than at this moment. It is time for the questioning and so we shall close this instrument. I am Laitos.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>We rejoin this communication. We are those of Laitos. We would correct the instrument. We are leaving, not to transfer, but in order that the one known as Latwii may speak. We leave you, therefore, in the love and in the light of the infinite Creator. We thank you and we shall be with you. Adonai, my friends. Adonai.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Jim channeling)</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we are most happy to greet you, my friends, as well, in the love and in the light of our infinite Creator. We have joined this merry group this evening, those seen and those unseen to your physical apparatus, and together we make quite a, as the previous instrument said, “rowdy group.” We shall at this time, as is our usual custom, open this session to the asking of questions in hopes that we might be of service in this manner. May we begin then with the first query?</p>
<p><strong>R:</strong> Yes, Latwii. First off, hello. I wonder if you could comment to me on the conditioning. The conditioning I received from Laitos is very similar to the conditioning I’ve received from you. A very unique difference, though—I mean it was very obvious that it wasn’t you, but yet the sensations were the same. And I remember once long ago you told me that you’d made an agreement with me that that would be the form of my conditioning, and I was wondering if that was the same agreement that Laitos had made and also if maybe times and circumstances had changed since then and can you tell me more about the actual technique that you used to do that [open to higher energies]. It was wonderful; it felt great. I’d like to thank Laitos for that too.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my brother. With each new instrument which we work with in the providing of the conditioning we are able by an unspoken, in most cases, agreement to utilize some portion of the instrument’s sensory system in order to become noticed, shall we say. In each instrument this manner or means of making our vibration available is somewhat different, though each new instrument will share much with others in how a conditioning is experienced. In your particular case we have been able to utilize certain anomalistic patterns within your, shall we say, electromagnetic energy field or aura in order to make our presence known to you.</p>
<p>As you or any new instrument proceeds along the path of balancing distortions, there become available finer and clearer means of making our presence known. This is a process which is congruent yet has a separate identity to the instrument’s own ability to increasingly perceive with greater clarity those contacts available to it. Therefore, as your own progress upon the evolutionary path proceeds, and as you make additional attempts to perceive our contact, there grow from these two closely intertwined processes an increased ability upon your part to perceive our contact.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my brother?</p>
<p><strong>R:</strong> I feel, I guess, kind of proud because I hadn’t been able to receive Laitos conditioning up until now. I guess you are able to reach the blockheads earlier than the rest of the Confederation. I have no question, just thank you for your services again, and Laitos and Hatonn also.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we thank you as well, my brother. In many cases it is not so much that we have a greater ability to transmit our thoughts to those who would receive them as it may occasionally be the case of simply using a bigger hammer, hopefully with some skill.</p>
<p>May we attempt another query at this time?</p>
<p><strong>N:</strong> Yes, Latwii. I wish to thank Laitos also. I wonder if there’s any way that individually we can increase our perception or, as Laitos once said, this group can increase the volume, so to speak. It seems that I know the words are there but I just can’t quite pull them out. I don’t know … even though I’m not trying to analyze, it just seems as if I’m reaching for the words but can’t quite pull it in. Do you have any suggestions in that respect?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my brother, and may suggest that as the newness of the vocalized channeling begins to wear off, then you will discover through your own patient persistence the ability to perceive that which seems at this point just beyond your ability. You are as one who has come in from a brightly lit day and has retreated to the darkness of the meditation room and yet looks with the eyes in a darkened room, attempting to make out the furniture in order that you may recline upon a comfortable piece for your meditation. It takes some, as you would say, of that called time for your eyes to become accustomed to the darker environment, and after a period of time and adjustment, then you perceive the furniture around you, dimly lit as it is. This is the process which you now experience in an analogous form as you attempt to become the vocal channel.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my brother?</p>
<p><strong>N:</strong> Yes, please. This may be somewhat divergent, but would one of my crystals help R?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we cannot give a specific answer to this query, for it is most general in its statement, and is therefore not well enough defined in order for us to answer with any hope of clarity. May we ask for a rephrasing of the query?</p>
<p><strong>N:</strong> I really don’t know how to rephrase. One of the crystals that I carry that I have charged, would it help R’s condition? I don’t know how to phrase than any way else.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we feel we have a better grasp of your query, though by asking if a crystal can help an entity, it is still somewhat of a general query which needs the focus. We feel you are, however, desirous of providing this charged crystal in the capacity of aiding that called disease and in this regard we may suggest that a crystal such as the one which you possess might be of aid to the one known as R if it were used by an entity which itself had become as the crystal, regular in its ability to perceive and transmit the infinite intelligence of the one Creator in a pure and undistorted fashion, that is, in the relative sense.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my brother?</p>
<p><strong>N:</strong> If I understand correctly then, I’m not that pure so the crystal wouldn’t really help. Is that the essence of the answer?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and this is a portion of our response, though we were not being ourselves specific as to any particular entity which might attempt to utilize the crystal. The utilization of the crystal would be helpful if utilized by any entity which had itself become regularized as is the crystal.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my brother?</p>
<p><strong>N:</strong> Without thwarting free will, is there any way that we can become regularized as a crystal, any method, any direction that we can take in that respect?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my brother. Indeed, there are as many ways as there are entities seeking such ways, my brother. There are throughout your history recorded a great many ways of the, as they are called, mystery schools which have been used throughout time and culture to remove those distortions within the entity seeking to become that known as the healer. Indeed, each entity upon your planet, whether it follows a path that has been studied throughout the ages, as you would say, or does not follow any conscious path at all, is pursuing the evolutionary path of mind, body and spirit which will eventually result in the entity becoming that which we have called crystallized, balanced or regularized in its ability to perceive and transmit those finer energies which are available to all. The choice of path is the choice of each seeker.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my brother?</p>
<p><strong>N:</strong> No, thank you very much. I guess I’m confused enough.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we do apologize for any confusion which we might have been responsible for. The queries which you have asked are queries which many, many books have been written about and which therefore are most difficult to summarize in a short and understandable manner.</p>
<p>May we attempt another query at this time?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> I guess I have a question. When Don Elkins was alive, he had a fellow once that had a very bad stomach condition. He could only [eat] baby food; he had bleeding ulcers. Don put the person into a more relaxed state, a light hypnotic state, and then talked to this person about perspective and not taking things so seriously. Whether as a coincidence or whether as cause and effect, the ulcer went away. Would this technique be helpful in working with the one known as R?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister. We find that there are many techniques that might be of aid to the one known as R or to any entity suffering that imbalance which is called disease among your peoples. Indeed, in many cases, it is not so much the technique that is used, but the intention with which the technique is used. The intention of the one to be healed is paramount in such an experience, for it is the desire and ability of the one to be healed which is the salient feature which then allows the healing to occur.</p>
<p>We find that there are some techniques which can enhance the effect of the intention to be healed and to provide healing catalyst. The technique which you have mentioned is one such technique, for it speaks more directly to the deeper portions of an entity’s mind in order that communication might be [enhanced], shall we say, and with less interference of the conscious mind.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> No, thank you.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we thank you, my sister. Is there another query at this time?</p>
<p class="comment">(Pause)</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we thank each of you, my friends, for allowing us to join you in your meditation this evening. We hope that we have not confused too many too much, for there is much time for that and there is apparently so little for the removal of confusion. We do not wish to add to your burdens, my friends. We shall at this time take our leave of this group and this instrument. As always, we leave you in that light and in that love which is our joy and privilege to share with you at all times. We are those of Latwii. Adonai, my friends. Adonai vasu borragus.</p>
