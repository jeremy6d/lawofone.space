<p>I am Hatonn. I and my people greet you in the love in and the light of our infinite Creator. We most heartily and humbly thank you that you have called to us this night and we bless each within this room in the name of light. May all that you manifest be as true as that which you manifest at this moment. This would be a part of our thoughts to aid you. It is one often missed by your peoples who are always striving for more—more food, more recreation, more freedom, more of everything, and yet more and less are irrelevant for you are who you are and what you are now at this moment, at this crux. You may choose freely and you may do well, for as far as we know, the Creator is kindly and affectionate to those of us who are upon the path and to those who are lost.</p>
<p>We apologize if there are pauses in this transmission. We are attempting to use single word contact which is somewhat more difficult to receive. However, this instrument requests that it may progress in this skill and this is the next step. This day, my friends, that is yours, that you have made, that the Creator and you have co-created, this day I say unto you is that which you are. If you have feasted, you have feasted upon yourself. If you have started, you have made your metaphysical being bones and rubble. This instrument has returned from the church, as you would call it, which is pleasing to her distortions with the wondrous feeling of the near end of the passion of the teacher known to you as Jesus. What this instrument has not realized is that before the one known as Jesus could be transformed, he had to die.</p>
<p>I would at this time transfer to another entity who channels. I am Hatonn.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(L channeling)</p>
<p>I am Hatonn. I am with this instrument. My friends, this day you celebrate a reawakening of a spirit. The one whom you call Jesus, the bearer of the Christ force, is recognized as a teacher among many of your people and rightfully so. But, my friends, you are all teachers, and each of you is but a vessel which may allow itself to accept the triviality which surrounds and permeates it. This reawakening is the object of the path of those who seek opportunities for service to others. In serving your brothers and perceiving the oneness of your self and your other selves, you allow the reality which exists about you to be made manifest through your own creative act. It is your act of creating, of placing your will, your self on this path that reawakens the sleeping world about you, that shatters the stone of confused perceptions which would hold you back, and that leads you forth to perceive the light of that day which dawns.</p>
<p>My friends, when the one known as Jesus stated, “All these things and more you shall do,” he foresaw the dawn to which each of you would awaken. My friends, the darkness of confusion can exist in your lives only for those moments you are willing to accept that condition. Therefore, my friends, simply go forward; follow your path and see within its light that which truly exists.</p>
<p>At this time, we shall relinquish our use of this instrument so that our brothers and sisters of Latwii might perform their service in answering questions. In the love and the light of the infinite Creator, we are known to you as Hatonn.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(L channeling)</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and I greet you, my brothers and sisters, in the love and the light of the infinite Creator, and would extend to those present our gratitude at being able to perform our service at this time. So without further ado, are their any questions?</p>
<p><strong>R:</strong> Yes, Latwii. The last time we spoke you recommended sweating to me and I’ve been doing that, and now I’m wondering if there’s maybe some kind of pacing that should be done. Is it well to sweat every day or should it be a once a week thing or once every couple of days?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. I am aware of your question. My brother, if you would but reflect for a moment, you would probably conclude that the process which you describe is a tool for the individual to attain growth upon their specific path, be it a path of service to self or service to others. At any rate, one who follows a path does not walk by the hour but by the growth. Therefore, we would suggest that rather than being attentive to a physical time schedule, one might be effectively benefited by a meditative process through which one determines whether it’s time yet.</p>
<p>May we answer you further?</p>
<p><strong>R:</strong> No, Latwii, thanks.</p>
<p>We thank you, my brother. Is there another question?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Well, just along those same lines, is there a way that you could abuse your body instead of helping it if you took sweats every day, for instance?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. I am aware of your question. My sister, the physical vehicle is quite adaptable and within a wide range [of] extremes is capable of accepting the stresses described with great frequency. This is not to suggest that such a course would be beneficial, as it is somewhat wearing upon that same physical vehicle. However, when accorded sufficient amounts of rest and nutrient, a high frequency of such experiences would not be damaging to a healthy physical vehicle. In greater specificity, however, we would suggest that one who like yourself [who] has a weakened physical condition should exercise greater caution.</p>
<p>May we answer further?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Rats. And no thank you.</p>
<p>Is there another question?</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong> Yes, Latwii. I’m an astrologer and I’ve been working on a project and I wonder if you could answer a question about a project I’m working on?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. My brother, as you are aware, there are limitations to the ability to answer specific questions without infringing upon the free will of the recipient of the answer. To do so would be no service and as our path is that of service to others, we would simply observe to you that we would be happy to be of whatever true assistance can be offered with respect to your free will fully observed. Is there a question you would like to present?</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong> Yes, this is a technical question more than one specific. I’m working on a way to correlate between the Mayan calendar which I’ve been studying for a number of years and the Julian calendar concerning a date that will indicate the close of the past 21,060 year cycle and the opening of the next 21,060 year cycle. There have been two dates that have been put forward: one is in 1989 and the other one is 2011, and I’ve been doing research on the later date, December 24, 2011, and I would wonder if you could comment on that and give me any information that you might have concerning that particular date.</p>
<p>I am Latwii. I am aware of your question. My brother, the moment in time of which you speak is one which could be regarded by many of your planet as quite significant to the physical plane. Beyond that statement, we regret that we must decline to proceed for two reasons, the first being the previously described reluctance to interfere, the second that we recognize a potential for development within the grasp of yourself if you would extend yourself to reliance upon that which you intuit to be correct, for the development of the sense of intuition within yourself is strong while the confidence upon that intuition within the area specific data is somewhat weak.</p>
<p>May we answer you further?</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong> Yes. Years ago I made a contact with an alien presence on this planet from the constellation Lyra from the specific star group near the star Vega which is a double star, and I wondered what the significance of that contact was since it hasn’t occurred again other than the fact that I’ve had two UFO experiences which may have been from the same source. I just wondered if you knew anything about the purpose of these particular beings on the Earth plane?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. My brother, you are quite familiar with the statement, “Ask and you shall receive.” There is within you a calling for that which is beyond the readily apparent illusion and your desire to receive assistance in determination of a path to follow was responded to in this fashion. This is not the result of an overall directorate, but more correctly a result of a natural law within that which exists. Your calling was made; your calling was answered.</p>
<p>Is there another question?</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong> No, thank you.</p>
<p>We thank you for the opportunity to be of service, my brother. Is there another question?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Latwii, I have a question about a contact that I made recently that claimed to have been a Confederation source by the name of Shirrah, and I was wondering if you could maybe verify the authenticity of it as being a Confederation source, and maybe give me some assistance on the work that it wishes to sort of cooperate in me doing?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and I am aware of your question. My brother, the contact which you describe was a contact which grafted the message of a service-to-self entity within the message initiated by an entity seeking to serve others such as yourself. This is not an uncommon effort made on the part of the service-to-self entity to attain greater polarity. For this reason, we would not attempt to describe a specific type of work which this combined entity, if you will, would seek for you to perform, for the divergent philosophies would hardly qualify as a single path or thread of thought or contact.</p>
<p>May we answer you further?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> No, thank you.</p>
<p>We thank you, my brother. Is there another question?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> How is the instrument doing?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. The instrument is in good condition, and is grateful for your care. Is there another question?</p>
<p><strong>N:</strong> Latwii, I wonder if you’d explain the difference between the Confederation and the Federation of Thirty-Three of Galactic Intent?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. I am aware of your question. My brother, the Confederation is an organization, if you will, of entities seeking to serve others within parameters understood by them as beneficial both toward their own seeking and the seeking of those whom they attempt to serve. The group to which you refer is a somewhat misunderstood group of similar effort whose communications have been confused, or if you will, contaminated by the injection of service-to-self communications within their overall effort.</p>
<p>May we answer you further?</p>
<p><strong>N:</strong> Then the members of the Federation of Thirty-Three of Galactic Intent are not necessarily service to others, is that correct?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. That is not correct. The intention of service to others is correct. The messages or communications from this source have been polluted by additional communications claiming falsely to be of that same origin.</p>
<p>May we answer you further?</p>
<p><strong>N:</strong> Yes. Is Lavendar a member of service to others or service to self?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. My brother, the information you desire is information that you must seek from within.</p>
<p>May we answer you further?</p>
<p><strong>N:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p>We thank you, my brother. Is there another question?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Yes, Latwii. I read a book called <em>The Treasure of El Dorado</em> in which it was stated that members of the White Brotherhood worked through spaceships circling our planet. Could you comment on that, please?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. My sister, the organization to which you refer is one which is in essence not an organization but rather a number of entities of similar purity and purpose. Their efforts … We shall pause.</p>
<p class="comment">(Sounds of a cat knocking over and spilling a jar of pencils and then the contents being gathered up.)</p>
<p>Their efforts have been highly successful in the direction of service to others and have worked in the manner which you have described.</p>
<p class="comment">(A sentence is inaudible due to the continuing sound of the pencils being gathered up and replaced on the table.)</p>
<p>Is there another question?</p>
<p><strong>N:</strong> Latwii, may I ask if the White Brotherhood is supposedly on a UFO or a space ship called the Star of Bethlehem which is encircling the Earth?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. My brother, the White Brotherhood, as you call it, is more correctly described as a group of highly developed entities or wanderers who have chosen at specific times to return either singly or in numbers to assist in specific fashions. They are not relegated, therefore, solely to specific physical vehicles or locations, for it is a calling that produces an effect rather than the tools of the trade, so to speak. The necessity does not exist for a specific physical location to contain the entirety of this group.</p>
<p>May we answer you further?</p>
<p><strong>N:</strong> Well, may I rephrase that question, and state that a number of the White Brotherhood may be present on such a vehicle as the Star of Bethlehem or TX-11 as well as the Brotherhood of Crystal or the Crystal Brotherhood. Just a number of them, not the entire group.</p>
<p>I am Latwii. My brother, we regret that we are unable to answer as we are not clear as to the content of your question, and respectfully request that it be posed again in simpler form.</p>
<p><strong>N:</strong> Are specific members of the White Brotherhood or the Crystal Brotherhood or other of the Thirty-Three Entities of the Federation of Galactic Intent in a space vehicle called the Star of Bethlehem or TX-11 which frequently is in the area and communicating with entities on Earth?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. Yes. Is there another question?</p>
<p><strong>N:</strong> No. Thank you.</p>
<p>We thank you. Is there another question?</p>
<p><strong>J:</strong> Latwii, I’ve been aware lately of a number of people who are experiencing back pain. The possibility has occurred to me that the catalyst for this back pain might be a common source rather than individual catalyst. Could you comment generally on that possibility?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. My sister, the perception that you have is accurate to a large extent in that the physical reality, if one might use that term loosely, is the result of the creative efforts of those on the job site. Therefore, it is not at all uncommon for a building, for example, with very low ceilings to produce backaches in those who choose to build it and occupy it.</p>
<p>May we answer you further?</p>
<p><strong>J:</strong> Umm. I’ll have to sort that answer out later. Could you give me any suggestions as to how people who are experiencing this back pain could use the catalyst more efficiently and not have to suffer the back pain so much?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. My sister, the pains which you describe are the alarm bell tolling, the entities individually informing themselves that their constructions are not up to their own standards. The catalyst is, in that sense …</p>
<p class="comment">(Side one of tape ends.)</p>
<p class="channel-type">(L channeling)</p>
<p>The catalyst is self-explanatory. It exists for the purpose of informing the individual that it is time to draw back from the illusion and analyze what mistakes are being made, just as one who attempts to occupy an habitation with four-foot ceilings will find discomfort to the extent that one in such a situation would eventually be driven to leave this habitation and regain the clarity of a perspective more in attunement with the individual’s desires. When the irritant ceases, so also will the pains you describe. The similarity within those you describe are the result of similar conditions of which those entities are recognizing a discomfort with.</p>
<p>May we answer you further?</p>
<p><strong>J:</strong> Yes, just one more thing. A book I read had an Indian medicine woman saying that when we turn our back on our own power, we experience back pains. I think I’m seeing some congruency between what you’re saying and what she said. Can you comment on that?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. My sister, when we turn our back on our own power, our power will eventually turn us back upon that which we should see. The function of the self is frequently that of gaining the attention of the conscious mind, either by stick or carrot, and the stick quite often is applied in the manner you describe.</p>
<p>May we answer you further?</p>
<p><strong>J:</strong> Yes, just one more question. If I finally pay attention to the stick, then do I get to have the catalyst some more or does it go away so I know that I’m getting the idea?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. My sister, we regret that we have managed to misplace the device that assigns catalyst for individuals. Therefore, we would suggest that a reduction in catalyst in this case can only be accomplished through the individual’s inner self communicating sufficiently to the individual the reason for the pain or attention-getter, and the steps which would be adequate to reduce the cause.</p>
<p>May we answer you further?</p>
<p><strong>J:</strong> Thank you, no. You’ve given me lots to think about. That was really good. Thank you.</p>
<p>We thank you, my sister. Is there another question?</p>
<p><strong>N:</strong> Yes, Latwii. There’s been a great deal discussed on healing of self by self. There seems to be numerous blocks in many individuals, or some individuals at least. Is part of this block due to a lack of silicon in the diet or is that irrelevant?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. My brother, the major lack would be described as consistency in pursuit of one’s path, for the spirit contains the ability to transmute that which is available into that which is needed. However, a lack of attention to the path has no panacea.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my brother?</p>
<p><strong>N:</strong> Well, considering a life of adequate attention to the path itself, is it true that we can communicate with various cells within our body as well with other areas outside of our body if the amount of silicon is at a proper level?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. My brother, we would suggest that one consider for a moment those cells which compose the hand, how with majestic telepathic ability the individual can cause those cells and their members to work in cohesive coordinated effort to raise the hand, extend the finger, and gracefully scratch the nose. Is this not communication, my brother? The difference is in the perception of what is accomplishable and what is unable to be accomplished. The individual who says to himself or herself, “My healing must come not from within but from outside,” is the individual who handicaps their own ability to be healed, for the statement, “Ask and you shall receive,” is again very evidently in application. He or she who insists that the healing must come from a doctor or healer handicaps their own ability to communicate and extend comfort and healing to the cells in the manner which you describe, and it is this handicap more than any other which retards the healing process.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my brother?</p>
<p><strong>N:</strong> Well, I think I understand, but I was referring to the self within self, not relying on outside sources primarily, and the fact that sometimes with a low silicon level we are unable to communicate with certain non-responsive areas inside our body, and that’s what I had primary reference to, not to consideration of an outside healer.</p>
<p>I am Latwii. My brother, we assure you that the extension of your will and your ability to create is not limited by the presence of specific elements.</p>
<p>May we answer you further?</p>
<p><strong>N:</strong> Thank you very much.</p>
<p>We thank you, my brother. Is there another question?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Yes, Latwii. There is a specific technique for healing of self and others called Reiki. Do you know of this, and could you comment on how the technique works?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. My sister, the techniques of healing are the tools within the tool bag of the builder. One builder might choose to drive a nail where another would choose to insert a screw, both for the purpose of creating a bond. Within the example given, each is sufficient, each is perfect, and each builder has performed admirably to accomplish that which was needed.</p>
<p>The various schools of healing all have the potential for substantial accomplishment and each is a set of tools which specifically serve some healers better than others. The tools themselves have no life, no healing ability, but rather are channels through which the healing occurs, and in truth this is the role of those referred to as the healer. They are the channels of energy through which two things primarily may be accomplished. The first, assisting the patient, if you will, in identifying and healing for themselves the injured areas, and second, extending a controlled vibration to the patient or a specific area of the patient’s physical vehicle to produce the desired effect.</p>
<p>The latter is generally of a very temporal nature, for that which occurs may be described as follows. The patient of his or her free will accepts the entry of the healer’s vibration within specific parameters. The healer projects his or her vibration and that vibration is accepted and retained by the injured area or the individual. It may be likened to a person within a bed sheet who opens a small hole, allowing the healer to reach through and touch. Once the healing process or extension of energy from the healer has ceased, the patient’s original vibration will reassume or reassert its dominance of the area. The rate at which this occurs is dependent upon the patient’s willingness to retain the vibration and the intensity of that cause which has resulted in the injury or disease.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> No. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>We thank you, my sister. Is there another question?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Yes. I’d like to know how the instrument is.</p>
<p>[I am Latwii.] The instrument is becoming somewhat fatigued and it would be wise to transfer the contact to a more rested instrument if further questions are forthcoming.</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> I think you ended up at about the same time they did.</p>
<p>I am Latwii. We thank you for your consideration, my sister, for the instrument’s well-being. Are there any more questions?</p>
<p class="comment">(Pause)</p>
<p>I am Latwii. As an air of compassion has filled the room, we will take our leave. Adonai, my friends. Vasu borragus. We are known to you as Latwii.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>I am Yadda, and I greet you in love and light. “Love and light, love and light,” this instrument causes me to go over and over. “Love and light.” However, we appreciate the need for the challenging. We come because we are called, and we have little to say. May we say, you are blessed and loved for yourselves. Many, many questions in this meeting about other people, about wise men and teachers, about constellations and galaxies. What do you wish to learn, my friends? What do you wish to know? Do you know yourself? There is that in the desire for knowledge which is a kind of contamination. For only learning is when one does not have. Once one has learned to wish for something, then one occupies one’s mind and abilities to getting this new gadget, if it may be a thought, a word, a game, a career, or a challenge. All your little toys, all the blocks that you may build, but you still do not know yourself.</p>
<p>We cannot say enough when we say, “Meditate, meditate, and mediate more.” What part of you do wish to have? If you are concentrating on yourself is it then a type of what this instrument calls spiritual pride? We hope not, my friends, for that is a real danger, and it will slow you up, it will cause you to move less fast. Once you have turned your attention to self, learn through self and not from self, for the universe within is such that the physically beheld creation in your density is as nothing. That, you are and more. We ask you not to be so concerned with the thoughts and the ideas and the playthings which are the toys of one who wishes to seek but in easy stages which shall not be too painful. We encourage you to meditate and find the joy and the peace which issues from a true knowledge of the self.</p>
<p>Who are you? Where are you going? And what do you believe the truth to be? Seek these things. Care not for the folly of the squabbles of relationships, the difficulties with making the money, but only view your living as one who has discovered dirt. Then one must automatically make up the soap in order that one may be clean. We are not not saying that before you noticed the dirt you were not dirty. We are only saying that the dirty man that is not aware does not need to discover soap. You have chosen to see the dirt. We encourage you to try to get your ring around the collar very clean. But please, do not puff yourself up as consequential, and do not puff up others. You must use your discrimination as always—on us, on any teacher, or on yourself. But remember: yourself first.</p>
<p>We thank you for allowing us to speak through this instrument. We make good contact. This good group. We blessed to be here and leave you in the love and the light of the One Who Is All. We are Yadda. Adonai. Adonai.</p>
