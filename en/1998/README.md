> Group question: What kind of souls are incarnating into the Earth plane now? Ra said there were those with third and fourth-density bodies activated and wanderers as well as those who would like to make the fourth-density graduation. Could you tell us something about the souls being born today?

> Group question: The question today concerns anger and frustration which we feel for ourselves, and we would like Q’uo to tell us how we can use these feelings to lead us along the path towards compassion for ourselves. Is there hope that we can change ourselves, or should we concentrate on accepting ourselves with the anger and all?

> Group question: The question this week has to do with the changing seasons in our spiritual life. We all have desires as spiritual seekers to do a certain spiritual practice: to meditate more frequently, to live more peacefully, to be more aware of what we are doing. We have a lot of different desires that we would like to see fulfilled, but it takes us a lot of effort and a long time to make our desires into the rituals and patterns of our lives. As we go on for a while with a pattern, it seems that at some point we need to make a change and a choice, and our further spiritual growth has to do with making new patterns. A part of us dies and a part is reborn. Would Q’uo talk to us about how these changing seasons come about? We would like to work in harmony with them and to have a better understanding as to how change happens in our lives. Is it really due to our desires and to our efforts and to the past that comes before the change, or does the change come because it is time for it to come, and it comes no matter what?

> Group question: We would like Q’uo to give us information as to how we can determine what our true heart’s desire is, that which is more central to the evolution of our soul rather than what we think we want as we go through our daily lives. We are wondering what you can tell us about determining and discovering what our true desire is.

> Group question: The question today has to do with acceptance. There are a number of people in the group today facing the possibility of a change in their life, of moving to a new location in the country or a new location in working or a new situation at home and we would like some information about how we can accept what the universe or the Creator gives us even though it might not look like what we wanted or what we had in mind. If Q’uo could talk to us about the quality of acceptance, the peace of mind and the harmony that we can achieve by acceptance, we would appreciate anything Q’uo could say.

> Group question: We would like information on the difficulties in relationships. We have times of doubt, fear, lack of trust and faith, and we want to know how to resolve these difficulties skillfully. How can we use contemplation, prayer and meditation to find harmony in our relationships?

> Group question: Our question today has to do with how we travel from head to heart in any spiritual belief that we may have and in the spiritual journey overall. It is easier to intellectually understand, for example, that all things happen in their time, than to actually wait for that time to come and accept it. Is it grace that brings this about? Just the right time?

> Group question: Our question this week concerns the concept of gratitude. How does gratitude work in the spiritual or metaphysical sense? It is said that it is a powerful force to have in the heart, just to be alive, to be breathing, and to serve the Creator. How does gratitude affect our spiritual growth, even in the worst of situations?

> Group question: Our question has to do with a quote which Ra made, “The source of all distortion is the limitation of the viewpoint.” We are wondering how, since each of us seems to bring various distortions with us into the illusion, these distortions affect that which we produce, whether we raise a family, create laws, beauty, dance, channel, whatever we do? How do our distortions in our personalities affect that which we hope to produce in our learning and our service in this incarnation?

> Group question: We would like to know if there is a best way to deal with a balance between the need to do something and waiting to let things happen naturally when we are going through big changes that may be an initiation or transition of a major nature in our lives? What is the balance between the work of the heart and the work of the mind in dealing with these changes?

> Group question: Our question today concerns the principle of spiritual pride. We are wondering how it fits into the sequence of catalyst that each of us works with in our lives. We all work with pride at some time or another. Some have said that it comes up last in our pattern, that it is sort of the culmination of all of our work. We would like for Q’uo to give us an idea of what spiritual pride is and how we work with it and if there is any particular time that is more appropriate to work with it than any other?

> Group question: The question today has to do with the concept of, “Not my will, but Thy will,” and when we are able to realize that this is the way we wish to behave and to live, what else can we do intellectually to assist bringing forth “Thy will” into our lives? How can we know “Thy will” and get out of the state of confusion in which we most often find ourselves, having given up our will and yet no particular direction shows itself to us? Is there anything that Q’uo could recommend to us that might strengthen our faith and our will?

> Group question: We would like to ask about the two ways that we experience ourselves: being caught up in the illusion, wandering about from thing to thing without being in the flow, of being there, and of enjoying the love and the light of the harmony of the moment. The other is being in the flow, which is the goal which most of us have. We are wondering if Q’uo could give us a description of how work in the metaphysical sense is being done both when we are not in the flow and when we are.
