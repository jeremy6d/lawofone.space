> Group question: The question today has to do with the general kind or level of angst that we each find in our lives no matter what the particular experience, whether we are not being able to fulfill our creative identity and desires we know we have, or the ability to find the balance in our lives so that we are able to move through our lives without being swayed overly much either towards the sadness or the joy, the ability to find balance between being and doing. Each of us seems to have some kind of angst, some necessity for dealing with a situation that is difficult, that provides us with worries, with fears, with challenges, with work of some nature that needs to be done. We are wanting to know if there is some level of changing this angst or this way of perceiving our experience so that we are more in line of what we feel is fulfilling our abilities, of walking a balanced life, of being of service to others, and wonder what you may have to say to us in that regard.

## [November 29, 1992, Sunday Meditation](en/1992/1992_1129)


> Group question: Group question: The question this afternoon has to do with our expectations. It seems like we’re always expecting, usually, more of ourselves than we actually accomplish and feeling poor about not having accomplished everything that we had in our expectations. We are wondering today what it is appropriate for the seeker of truth to expect both in the mundane everyday life and of the self in the spiritual life, the metaphysical world. What kind of expectations are reasonable, are helpful and are appropriate for the seeker of truth in both of these areas?

> Group question: The question this afternoon has to do with the general concept of how do we deal with loss, in a conscious manner, so that we are able to get the most benefit out of the experience? How do we either exercise our will or move our will aside or find a harmonious way of using a sense of grief of loss, of separation that comes when relationship ends, a relationship that has been emotionally satisfying and nurturing for us? That is the specific question, and, in general, how do we allow the greater will to move through our lives so that our small will, that may or may not be informed, can become a part of the movement of the pattern of our incarnation that brings us eventually to the realization of the unity and acceptance?

> Group question: Today’s question has to do with our attitude. We have various attitudes, each of us, that help us or cause us to look at situations in a certain way. We would like to know a number of things about attitude. First of all, does the attitude that we have have a direct relationship to the lessons that we wish to learn if we wish to affect our attitude in order to change the way we experience our lives on a day-to-day basis? Is this something that is worthwhile doing? If so, how can we affect our attitude in a way that is meaningful rather than in the usual judging ourselves by how much we do, what we do, or how well we do it [the accomplishment factor]?

> Group question: The question this afternoon has to deal with the relationship both between males and females and the male and female portion of our brain/mind complex. We would like to know what you could tell us about this dynamic relationship, wherein the subconscious mind—the female portion—seems to be the potentiator, the one which sets into action the male portion of the mind, and in our human relationships, the male and female come together in a relationship and seem to go through the use of catalyst whereby the female undertakes the task, shall we say, of civilizing or training the male so that there is the opportunity for the male to learn the harmonious relationship and communication and sensitivity to emotions that is provided by the female, and the female has the opportunity to learn the abilities of the male to physically accomplish tasks, to go out into the world and, shall we say, “bring home the bacon.”

> Group question: The question this afternoon deals with how we really accomplish whatever it is we accomplish in our lives. We know we have feelings that come from our heart, that direct us in certain ways, and we know that we can analyze with our minds any feeling or possibility, and we are wondering, particularly in Carla’s case let us say, where she experienced what seems to be a rather miraculous healing, whether this kind of healing or growth is a product of chance, of luck, of application of the intellect, of the following of the heart, of the balancing of the intellect and the heart? How anybody in general can use the intellect to assess all of the possibilities in a situation, among them being the feeling that we have in the heart, the desire to be of service to others, and to express compassion to others at all times. What part does the intellect play, what part does the heart play, and is there a balance really possible? Or should we always go with the heart?

It is a grace to be here in this room from which so much light emanates.

> Question for S: The question we’re considering this afternoon for S is why things seem to have gone so far astray from the path that allowed her to provide the most service to others, and that was when her husband R was alive she had the opportunity of being in a mated relationship and of helping a family to communicate and to live together and to grow together and she felt that in that role she was able to provide services that were hers to provide. Now that R is dead she is faced with possibilities that just don’t feel like they are right—going to school and taking classes that she has no interest in and pursuing a career working outside the home, which also seems to be a dead end as far as interest and opportunity to be of service. The picture of her life seems to have a number of dead ends and we are wondering this afternoon what kinds of considerations should be foremost in her mind, what opportunities are presented by the seeming dead ends, is there something that she’s missing, is there something wrong with this picture, and if so what is it?

> Group question: In an out-of-body experience—which is the question this afternoon—when the exit is via the crown of the head there is impression of movement, at great speed, as if one were drawn up through a tunnel or a funnel. Please describe this process and account for this impression. We would like to know, in this area of out-of-body experience, if this feeling of movement is actual. Does it take place in time/space? Is it a movement in consciousness or is it simply a feeling of movement that accompanies a more profound experience or process?

Would you kindly continue from the point as follows: “… you may embody that truth and then, through the quality of reflected love within the self, may open doors in service to one or a few or many entities. When light is considered, consider also that it is [not an] artifact of time and space nor does it transcend the illusion in the way logically or intuitively available to the educated mind. We encourage the consideration of …” (Contact was terminated at this point in the last session.)

> Group question: This afternoon we have talked about topics ranging from the feeling of the loss of control over the environment around us to the fear within ourselves that we might not be able to survive economically. Rapid change, frustration, learning how to balance various positive and negative aspects of our lives yet remain within an equilibrium that we feel is the quality that is most helpful in dealing with most of these various forms of catalyst and stimulus and also is the fruit, shall we say, of successfully balancing the opposites in our experience. We are aware that this centeredness and this feeling of equilibrium is important to incorporate into our lives. We are wondering if there are suggestions that you would have as to how we could more easily incorporate or find ourselves with that feeling of centeredness, equilibrium and balance. Are there certain attitudes that would help? Humor, meditation, or anything else?

> Group question: My name is K, and I will give a preamble to the basic question by giving some details on why I am interested in this question. My interest is in the Law of One, especially as it pertains to the manifested world. Current science states that many manifested variations are caused by multiple forces and laws, and is the outcome of compartmentalization brought about by specialization and the many scientific disciplines. There is but one law and one cause. Walter Russel produced the most comprehensive study of the Law of One and some of his writings are in this room now. Nicola Tesla, or Tesla’s inventions, gave most practical demonstration of this law. Tesla’s work was performed when the electrical applications were in their infancy, hence were somewhat crude and cumbersome, yet functional. Russel suggested the use of vortical coils to generate heat, and the details of that are also in the documents that are available in this room. The current need to find alternative power generation methods due to environmental pollution and … crystal technology is not appropriate at present, although it is the preferred solution, therefore there is the need to investigate Russel’s suggestions to determine the viability of vortical coils. Three possible solutions from vortical coils are as follows: the first is the one suggested by Russel which is to produce steam from water cooled centering units which are placed in the center of the vortical coils. One could also use the increased electrical energy at the vortical coils centers. The third possibility is to use vortical coils to generate torque to drive alternator shafts. Please discuss the viability of these options.

> Group question: With today’s question we are asking what kinds of service that the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator has to offer the population of our planet. We are aware, of course, of the channeling service we offer here, we are also aware that there are inspirational dreams where people are helped with the direction in their lives and the services they are to offer, and the lessons they are to learn, with coincidental meetings, with people, books, ideas that are important for the person to be concentrating on … and we are wondering if there are other services? In what ways does the Confederation offer itself to the people of our planet, and are there cycles or seasons of certain services so that it is felt that some are more helpful at a certain point in a person’s or population’s evolution and other services are more helpful at another time? For example, with so much channeling going on today all over the planet, and there being so much that is of questionable value, does channeling or any other service after a while tend to lose effectiveness so that there is the need to move on to other kinds of services?

> Group question: The question today has to do with accepting the limitations that are put on us by our own point of view, by physical illness, and by physical limitations. And we’re wondering if there is a value to feeling the frustration of limitation, or if there is instead a need to separate oneself from the illusion, not be so affected by it—to be more, shall we say, at a distance? Or is it better for us to be immersed in the illusion, to be moved by it, to be emotionally swayed, and then to look at what results and do our balancing according to how the illusion has moved us?

> Group question: The question this afternoon has to do with changes and transitions and the use of faith in making these transitions. The issues or lessons of our lives seem to be the lens through which we look at our lives, and we’re wondering if, as we continue to walk on our path and go through the various changes and learning of lessons, if we are able to provide our own inspiration for this journey by simply making the journey—a kind of perpetual motion machine—so that we gain the confidence of being able to make transitions and to solve problems by doing it. And yet, we find that these issues or problems are with us at deeper levels, showing other aspects and requiring the continued application of faith and will in order to continue on the journey.

When we hear these voices, is there the need or any benefit to bringing the voices under any kind of supervision or control? Is it well to allow each voice to speak its own message and then determine what value the message has for us?

What would be your recommendation as to how we can be enough in the moment to be able to do any kind of channeling that we wish whether that would be to channel alive, a relationship, a job or a message from another entity?

> Group question: The question this afternoon has to do with how we accept those retrograde moments when the world around us does not seem to respond in a way in which we would either want it to or expect it to—whether it is a desire we have to control a situation and make it come out the way we think would be favorable; or relate to another person in a way we think is most harmonious, and yet the person or the situation does not seem to allow us to do that; or when we wish to live according to our highest ideals but find ourselves falling short, and we tend to make ourselves feel guilty because we have not done that which we feel is within our capability to do. How do we deal with our own feelings of falling short, how do we accept the moments when we are in the midst of anguish, and what is the most effective way of handling these moments where we find disharmony within ourselves or another and we feel that we have been responsible for that.

> Group question: The question this afternoon deals with the concept of change and transformation, and the confusion, the anger, the frustration that comes when we don’t feel that we’re changing in the way that we wish to change. Most students of their own evolution look at their lives, and, at some time, attempt to match the life with the ideals that they hold, and feel that there are certain things that they can do. But most of us look at our attempts to change and feel that we are inadequate in our change and that we are perhaps not even moving in the right direction. And as we begin to change and have this confusion and anger, we become further befuddled when we don’t move as we wish.

> Group question: The question this evening has to do with the concept of gurus. In many of the eastern traditions a guru is seen as an indispensable part of the seeker’s journey, that no true enlightenment can occur unless the seeker follows the footsteps of the guru, and puts him or herself under the guru’s guidance and instruction. In the west we have various religious traditions, the protestant and the catholic focusing around the entity Jesus Christ and this is a kind of guruship where there is a model or there are footsteps left, patterns and rituals, the use of faith and will to live a life as described by Jesus. How important to a seeker is the concept of the guru, the dispeller of darkness, the one who makes the model or lives the life that is patterned in a fashion that can aid a seeker along the journey of evolution? How much of that quality of the guru can we find within ourselves and how much of that finding is made possible or only possible with the assistance of a guru?

> Group question: The question today has to do with the concept of the ethics of control. When we are in relationship with friends or family, especially children, we often find ourselves in the situation of exerting some sort of influence over the person, oftentimes for his or her own good. We do this to friends, family and even to ourselves, controlling our behavior, our thoughts, our responses, in order to make them align with what we think is more appropriate or “higher” or better. And we are wondering today what the ethics are of attempting to affect our own, and especially other peoples’, behavior because we think that the effect we desire is better or more appropriate or will be more helpful to the person in the long run. What are the ethics or results, metaphysically and spiritually, of attempting to affect other peoples’ behavior in this fashion?

We look in our individual lives and we attempt to discover the principles by which we live, and those which we would carry out in our daily lives, and we see metaphysical and spiritual qualities that we appreciate. We join with others and attempt to aid each other in groups, and yet we find that many times the groups have differences among themselves, within the group and from group to group. There is separation and division, and the unifying factors that we believed in don’t seem to hold us together.

How this interaction can produce a symbiotic relationship and create a wholeness of experience, a wholeness of being, so that we are inspired to move in the direction that is most appropriate by the subconscious, and inspired to accomplish the work that is before us. How can we gain a clearer, more stable access to that subconscious, feminine portion of our minds; how can we learn to appreciate this process? What exactly occurs in this process when the inspiration is given from the subconscious to the conscious, where does it come from, how is the subconscious aligned with our overall pattern of learning and serving that allows this process to occur? How can we, as we appreciate our own subconscious mind and ability to transform ourselves, how can we become examples or teachers or facilitators to others who may come to us seeking this kind of assistance?

> Group question: The question this afternoon has to do with the general topic of how do we cooperate with our destiny? How do we use our free will in making choices that when they are made will perhaps change us in very significant ways as we are all seeking, as portions of the Creator, to return to the Creator—each choice becomes a part of our path, a step that may be unlike any other step we’ve taken, but becomes as integral as any step we have taken? How can we make enlightened choices? How can we cooperate with that which is our highest and brightest path in learning and serving others?

> Group question: The question this week has to do with “why.” Why, if there is a benevolent, higher force that we might call God or the Creator, is there so much sorrow, suffering, sickness, violence, disease and general disharmony in the world, in individual and in group experiences? Why do people have to go through so much difficulty in order to just survive in many cases? Why is there not a more active participation, either on the part of the Creator or the forces of light, the angelic beings, to intervene and to provide sustenance, relief, healing and so forth on all the levels—mind, body, spirit and emotions?

> Group question: The question this afternoon deals with behavior that is intended to be of service to others but which seems, in the eyes of the one offering the service, to fall short because the one that one is attempting to serve is somehow impaired, either perhaps by old age and difficulty in remembering conversations and visits, or by alcoholism so that the memory there is also faulty, or perhaps just a pattern of behavior that has been set up through the life that makes it difficult to really feel like one is making a solid contact, that there is clear communication, and that there has been a recognition of the visit, of the service, of words, of conversations.

> Group question: The question this afternoon has to do with truth, personal truth in particular, when we are speaking to ourselves or to any other person and relying on what we feel is a personal truth or a general truth. Is there some way in which we can present this information so that the person to whom we are speaking can get the feel for what we see as a truth, and yet realize that the information may not be as particularly applicable to them as it is to us?

## [April 10, 1992, The Aaron/Q’uo Dialogues, Session 7](en/1992/1992_0410)


> Aaron: I would like to continue where we left off last night, to ask you to consider service in still newer ways. Service is a manifestation of love. We spoke last night about being service rather than doing service, the ways that doing creates a distortion of self and other, of server and served. Being service is simply opening of yourself and moving away from any duality.

## [April 9, 1992, The Aaron/Q’uo Dialogues, Session 6](en/1992/1992_0409)


> Aaron: No decision has been made as to the nature of the questions or the direction of the channeling tonight, and it is not my place to direct this, but I would like to offer a suggestion that it feels relevant to me that we speak, at least to some extent, about the nature of service and the misconceptions that the incarnate being may move into about the nature of service which create a distortion in that service and give rise to fear. I would pause here for your responses to this suggestion. That is all.

## [April 5, 1992, Sunday Meditation](en/1992/1992_0405)


> Group question: The topic this afternoon has to do with communication, especially communication between partners or people who are very close in their relationships, where we would expect that such a situation would lend itself to clearer and easier communication than one with perhaps a stranger. What occurs frequently is that there is a difficulty or a baffling in the communication, where even though both people try to their best abilities to communicate clearly, there is something that injects itself in the communication that causes a difficulty or a muddying of the communication. What would be the advice in such a situation? Would it be better if we attempted to stick it out and work as hard as we can with the person and to finally achieve a mutually agreed-upon clear communication? Or, when you find such difficulties and they recur, perhaps as a pattern, is it better to look at yourself in the contemplative or the meditative state to see if there might be some kind of an internal blockage or problem that you are working with in that particular area where the communication is unclear? Would that be an avenue that might provide clarification, not only to that particular communication, but in your ability to communicate in general? What would be the advice in such a situation as a way by which we could clear our communication?

> Group question: The question this afternoon has to do with relationships in general, and in particular, when we find ourselves in a relationship that isn’t exactly to our needs or specifications, how we can accept that portion of the relationship that is other than we would have it be, if it is to be the spouse, or ourselves, or the situations that we find ourselves in, whether they are financial or social or any situation that we would like to change and seems to be unchanging, or perhaps changing too quickly? How can we find within ourselves the acceptance and the support that will help us to help our spouse and to strengthen the relationship so that the relationship and the ideals for which it stands will endure?
