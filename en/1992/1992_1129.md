<p class="group-question"><strong>Group question:</strong> The question this afternoon has to do with our expectations. It seems like weâ€™re always expecting, usually, more of ourselves than we actually accomplish and feeling poor about not having accomplished everything that we had in our expectations. We are wondering today what it is appropriate for the seeker of truth to expect both in the mundane everyday life and of the self in the spiritual life, the metaphysical world. What kind of expectations are reasonable, are helpful and are appropriate for the seeker of truth in both of these areas?</p>
