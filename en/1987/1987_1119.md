<p>I am Laitos. I greet you in the love and the light of the infinite Creator. We have had much difficulty getting the attention of the one known as D, as we find this instrument to be placed in a position wherein the promptings of the subconscious mind are rigidly enough controlled that subconscious thought is not being given free flow into the conscious mental apparatus used for making decisions. We would suggest that the instrument known as D, as well as each within the circle, realize and give value to the shyly hidden offerings of the subconscious mind, for deep concepts arise within the intuitive portion of the conscious mind only if there is a certain level of coordination betwixt the two minds, a certain mutual respect and conscious awareness each of the other.</p>
<p>We would like to speak this evening about love. We choose this subject not in spite of its familiarity or its centrality, but because of it. We have a desire to express enough consciously known principles as concepts to the new instrument that it will, by simple repetition of exercises, each concept being one exercise, regain the feeling of some small confidence within the one known as D.</p>
<p>That which each is is far other than the conscious mind can hope. These concepts which we channel due to your service are mere surface paint which glistens in the sun upon the surfaces beneath which lie the substantial metal of beingness. The process of channeling is a process of service to others. The entity which one brings to that service needs to be respected in its entirety. Both those things which are civilized, learned behaviors, and so forth, and those things which are archaic and seemingly vestigial, that is, instinct and the force deep within the mystery of the inner being, which is that very stuff which created all that there is within the infinite universes, sink down, then, within the conscious mind, becoming more and more [aware], more and more attuned to the slightest lifting of the veil between conscious and subconscious.</p>
<p>We would speak, as we said, of love. We would offer familiar words. We would speak of that love which goes beyond human expression, that love which men seek after without any proof of its existence. We speak of a Creator whose very nature is love. Each particle of consciousness has that seed of love at its center, known as the birthright of what this instrument would call divinity. Such words are not adequate, yet language is a difficult and limiting way to communicate. Before all else was, love is, and when the last sun flares into nova and shrinks into ultimate gravity, love still is, the Creator, endlessly brooding upon infinities, <em>(inaudible)</em>. And yet, this vast and mysterious love may be expressed within your illusion.</p>
<p>We will transfer to the one known as D at this time, asking as usual that the instrument accept thoughts as they arise, speak them, and be unafraid, refraining always from analysis during the exercise. I am Laitos. I transfer now.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(D channeling)</p>
<p>I am Laitos, and greet you again, our greeting in light and love being our way of answering your challenge. We wish to be channels of the infinite love that comes from one source, conduits by performing our humble service of love, brought from that source to the beings of third dimensions. …</p>

<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>I am Laitos, and I am again with this instrument. We would like to thank the one known as D for his work and his willingness. We continue to feel that we are making good progress. The instrument will wish to know whether the variances in level of relaxation affect the channeling work, and perhaps the instrument need only remember the varying state of mind during this channeling exercise while gazing at or listening to the words to discover how very helpful it is to maintain a single point of focus during the channeling, for neither worrying nor considering—that is, neither worrying about what has been said nor considering what shall be said—and focusing only upon the immediacy, the breathing, the heartbeat, the slight but audible sound of the pressure of blood in the ear, the night sounds, all those things which go into being in the present and focused upon an inner listening.</p>
<p>We suggest as an exercise that the instrument work with imagery in meditation, holding shapes and colors within the mind for as long as possible. The instrument should not be discouraged at discovering the willfulness of the mind which wishes not to concentrate upon one image. A few seconds at first shall be a challenge to sustain. Yet this type of concentration is most helpful to the work of channeling, and where the conscious mind in its restless intelligence is used to roving in thought, there must needs be means of disciplining that very helpful thing, the intellect, and stilling its forward pace for the purpose of experiencing the present moment, as would one without the rational mind.</p>
<p>We do, however, continue to emphasize that the rational mind be tuned carefully before the control is given over to the intuitive self, and further we suggest that the powers of analysis are most helpful in revealing the experience of the intuitive mind and its fruit in collaboration with us who are of the principle of love. We feel that the encouragement which we offer the instrument is to an extent blocked by the instrument’s dissatisfaction, and we ask that the instrument set aside that dissatisfaction or need to please the self, for in this matter the process of learning to serve as a vocal channel is greatly helped by a veritable lack of interest in the excellence of one’s own work when one is not within the channeling mode of perception.</p>
<p>What we are saying is that this phenomenon is most natural and is in fact a portion of the birthright of the intuitive mind, that portion of the mind which is the largest, that being the frontal minds of your brain, yet being by far the least respected and the least used by your culture. Intuition vanishes upon attention and advances upon a relaxed peripheral view. Those who see intuitively see without focus and speak without hindrance, so many learn to channel themselves in spontaneity and joy and some few discipline that faculty for use as a medium through which impersonal principles may find [an] attuned gateway which resonates in energy with itself and which can thus be used to be of mutual service to those who may find value in words of love.</p>
<p>At this time we would transfer to the one known as Jim that this instrument may field queries and speak further. We transfer at this time. I am Laitos.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Jim channeling)</p>
<p>I am Laitos, and greet each again through this instrument. We realize that we have exercised the one known as Carla and the one known as D to an extensive degree this evening, hopefully providing both exercise and information to each instrument. At this time we would offer ourselves in the attempt to speak upon any topic which those present may find the value in the asking. Is there a query to which we may speak?</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong> Is what you were just saying about concern for the excellence of the material or for the excellence of the channeling meant to … I’m a little confused as far as my own efforts to get your feedback and make use of it, and whether that whole effort to do that through these questions is somehow misguided. I need a little clarification about that still. Does it show a wrong sort of concern of mine, for instance, in my questions in the past about the details of my own channeling?</p>
<p>I am Laitos, and, my brother, we would encourage your queries for as long as the information which is given in response to them has meaning to you. It is eventually hoped that each new instrument, through the exercise of its vocal channeling ability and through the resolution of difficulties and queries, both from our source and from those serving as teachers, might provide the necessary confidence that will allow a new instrument to proceed fearlessly and even foolishly in the chosen art. Thus, we are happy to speak to any query which you may find necessary in order to enhance your own understanding of the process that is now being actualized within your being, my brother.</p>
<p>Is there another query?</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong> Well, I still don’t quite understand what you were saying a short while ago about concern for the performance except during the performance. I’ve kind of lost my question, but I got the impression that the concerns that prompt me to ask about my performance were somehow misguided and … I’m sorry, I don’t know how to ask this question. I do have another, however, and that is just very simply, if tonight I completed my channeling of you at the point at which you were ready to end it. I’ve felt in the past somewhat as if I stopped it because of my own fatigue and tonight I felt no fatigue, I just felt …</p>
<p class="comment">(Side one of tape ends.)</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Jim channeling)</p>
<p>I am Laitos, and am again with this instrument. We would speak to your first query, if we may, before addressing the second. We suggest the concern for the excellence of the effort be the focus of one’s attention previous to and then following the exercise of the vocal channeling ability, and the giving over of any concerns for such excellence while one is serving as a vocal channel, for it is at that time that the analytical mind does not serve one well, for it is that analysis which is the greatest stumbling block for the new or old instrument. It is at that time that such analysis is given over to a surrender that will allow a clearing of the mind in order that impressions of those such as we are might be transmitted through the instrument.</p>
<p>In regards to your second query, we were quite happy to have been able to utilize your instrument for the greater portion of the time which we felt was appropriate for the exercise of a new instrument before either physical or mental fatigue tends to remove the one-pointed focus that is so critical in being able to transmit concepts as they occur and are perceived within the mind complex. Thus, we this evening were able to utilize your instrument to a greater degree than we have previously and are very pleased to be able to make this report.</p>
<p>May we speak further, my brother?</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong> I appreciate that. I really was wondering if I responded to your ceasing to come through me, or if you would have gladly—if you were continuing to attempt to stimulate concepts that I had become just unable to respond to?</p>
<p>I am Laitos, and we were able to stimulate those concepts which we were utilizing both from our own source and those which we wished to choose from your experience and framework of conceptualization, shall we say, for we wish to use that which each instrument has to offer as an unique portion of its own seeking to enhance the message which is always and ever the same. Each seeker will refine the shared path of seeking in a manner which enriches that path when shared with another. Thus, this evening we were able to blend your offering with our own in a manner which we found of a balanced nature.</p>
<p>May we speak further, my brother?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> I think what he’s asking is, “Was the next that you were going to transmit that you were going to transfer?”</p>
<p>I am Laitos. We had some further information available that we could have transmitted had the instrument’s focus been steadier at that point. However, it was beginning to falter and there was then seen the need for the transfer of the contact in order that the new instrument not become disheartened that it was not maintaining the validity that it had previously demonstrated.</p>
<p>May we speak further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Not on my account. I spoke only for D. You need anything further, D?</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong> I have another question. In weeks past you and—I’m sorry I don’t remember whether it was Hatonn or who—made the analogy of channeling with catching a baseball and throwing it in order to free the hands in order to catch the ball again. In other words, to receive a word or a few words, speak them, in order to free the mind to receive more. And yet it’s also been stressed that you work through stimulating concepts on the subconscious level through which we find the words. And I see these two ideas being somewhat in conflict with each other. Can you resolve that and help me to understand a little more deeply just what this process is?</p>
<p>I am Laitos. Whether the words which are perceived are words which we transmit in a word by word fashion or words which the instrument fashions in order to describe a concept which has been transmitted, the idea of throwing or speaking these words fearlessly is that which is helpful to the instrument, for the passing of the words is that which clears the way for further words, be they those which we have distinctly transmitted or those which the instrument has found to be the most nearly appropriate to describe the concept which we have transmitted as well. We utilize from time to time combinations of the concept and the word by word transmission as is most efficacious for each instrument. Most will find the concept means of transmission the easiest to utilize in the beginning of the service as a vocal instrument, with the addition of the word by word method of contact being that which is undertaken at a later or more advanced stage of serving as a vocal instrument.</p>
<p>May we speak further, my brother?</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong> No, thank you very much.</p>
<p>I am Laitos. We thank you once again, my brother. Is there a further query at this time?</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong> None from me.</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Thank you, Laitos.</p>
<p>I am Laitos, and we also wish to thank each for the great offering of attention and service which we have experienced this evening. We appreciate the opportunity to speak our humble words through each instrument, and find a great joy in being able to transmit concepts through both the old, shall we say, and the new instruments in order that there might be some small enlightening of service and of the mental preparation for service in each instrument. We ourselves gain a great deal of experience as we work with each instrument, and feel that that which you offer to us is far greater than you can imagine, for we learn as we teach to be clearer channels for the love and light of the one Creator.</p>
<p>At this time we shall again thank each instrument, and, as always, leave each in the love and in the light of the one infinite Creator. We are known to you as those of Laitos. Adonai, my friends. Adonai.</p>
