<p>I am Calenda. I greet you in the love and the light of the one infinite, perfect, omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent Creator. We greet you as those who glow with the crystalline purity and who see those emanations from yourselves.</p>
<p>Woe, woe. You line the treasure boxes of your inward storage with the archives of mediocrity, with fashion and news.</p>
<p>I am Calenda. A voice who calls the true jewel to awaken within. I wish to be your walking stick upon the path. I wish to join my ceaseless prayer with the murmuring of all those within your race who pray incessantly, night and day, casting themselves upon that dark mystery of deity. Perhaps my voice has no use other than as an interesting friend who is new, is interesting. Yet, we burn within with the glory of compassion and with the joy of the yearning and adoration we feel for the marvelous tract, this heavenly pilgrimage, this journey within. We, too, are on that path.</p>
<p>We are sorry we have importuned this instrument, but the instrument [was] able to pick up our contact, something not often occurring, and we wished to share our love and our celebration of all that is.</p>
<p>We of Calenda leave you in the love and the light of the One.</p>
