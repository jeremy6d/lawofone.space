> Group question: On Breatharianism, the living on the air or sunlight, the prana, rather than on solid foods or liquids. What is it necessary for the third density human body to live upon in truth? Is it always necessary to live on the normal food and water, or at some point is it possible to live without these particular ingredients and to live upon a more pure substance that we would call air or prana?

> Group question: Concerns wanderers, the difficulty that wanderers frequently encounter being within the third-density illusion, having to go through the forgetting process, and having some kind of a memory of previous existence and purpose for the current incarnation, yet running into, perhaps, problems in making that happen or manifesting it.

We wish to say at this time, for this call has come to us, that the love and light of the infinite Creator takes great measures of energy to probe into at any depth at all. The delicate balance between the positive and the negative move and turn, sway and twist within the distortions of each mind/body/spirit complex’s universe, within each heart and each mind. For every excellent ideal and symbol, there lies upon just the other side of the coin, terror, need, ugliness and violence.”

> Group question: “Hatonn: This evening it is our desire to work with the basic visualization in the inner self by which the vocal channeling is transmitted. In order to offer a disciplined experience of this, we would like to tell a story in round-robin fashion, speaking only a short while through each instrument and continuing ’round and ’round until the story is done. This is excellent practice for the channel as the story is not long (inaudible) yet in the end it will be seen to have flown easily in meaning and texture.”

We will start with this instrument and move according to that name given in each piece of channeled material. You see, my friends, there comes a time when the new channel must shake itself loose from the dependence upon known subject matter by the telling of a story in small segments, each instrument giving only a small part of the story. The mind of the channel may be at rest, for it knows not how the story comes out, it being a story never told before.”

> Group question: “Hatonn: We would wish to turn the attention to the blessedness of the intention to serve. When entities discover within themselves the desire to serve, they cast about for a satisfactory path of service and frequently become embroiled in the mechanics of producing the chosen service. In that seeking forth the perfect service, life and joy are stripped from the endeavor. This is not to say that it is not valuable to continually improve and refine one’s ability to serve, one’s perspicacity and tact in service. However, the analytical mind often takes over the faculty of evaluation from the proper means of evaluation, that is, the deeper self, and in that surface evaluation of the attempt to be of service, many imperfections are found and thus the seeker becomes disappointed in the self and in the service. This adversely affects future attempts at service as entities become disillusioned with their own abilities.”

> Group question: “Hatonn: We would say a few words about the practice of vocal channeling. First of all, we feel it is important to stress that channeling is not alien to the condition of humankind, but is inherent in the nature of mind, body and spirit which is called personality, for the spirit dwells within mind and body and expresses itself and receives nourishment in such distorted or clear fashion as the body chooses to channel to it and accept from it. All of the life experience is, in essence, a channeling of some force, either within or without the self into each action of the self.”

> Group question: Concerning the attitude and action to take toward and in response to the world being too much with one, the regular daily routine and maybe a few added difficulties seeming to bring a heavier burden to the shoulders. How does one respond? How does one look at it, and what is the most effective attitude to view such?

> Group question: (From Carla.) Concerning exceeding one’s limitations in the hopes of maintaining a positive attitude under adverse circumstances. For her, it’s physical health. How do you know that you’ve done all you can, without pushing too far and injuring yourself by the pushing, and how do you be sure that you’ve pushed far enough to maintain the positive point of view and enhance your chances of healing thereby?

> Quanta: I am known to you as Quanta. I do greet you in the love and in the light of the one infinite Creator and am sorry for the amount of time which it took our entity to examine, rehabilitate and use a thought form which was available to us. We were not ready for the challenge of this instrument for we were not completely familiar with the entity Jesus the Christ. However, we are of a vibration which is a blend of two worlds—the metaphysical planes exterior to your planet and the metaphysical planes interior to its sphere of influence.

Indeed, we speak of the most beautiful and rare, indeed, unique, of all treasures—the treasure that knows it is a treasure—the self-conscious seeking entity.”

> Group question: What style of life makes one more adaptable to the spiritual journey, whether it might be the more community oriented lifestyle of the Communist China where the individual is programmed and taught to think of the welfare of the group, or the type of lifestyle of the hermit who lives secluded for years contemplating the Creator, or the style of life that we ordinary American citizens enjoy where we have many temptations and ability to express ourselves in whatever way we choose?

I am not a member of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator, nor am I a social being, but an individual as are each of you. I speak from an icy fastness far from humankind, and wish to contact this instrument for the purpose of sharing the joy of experiencing what I would call the end of the personal trail of my life. I have placed myself in my final resting place and will soon be gone from this Earthly habitation. My path has been strange, and I am most honored to be able to share with those who may share sympathy with me and wish me well, the story of my life.”

> Group question: “Q’uo: We would speak to you this evening about love. The call this evening circles around many concerns, yet there is only one response to the many-sided concern of illusion, and that is gently, cleanly and with grace to suggest the turning of the attention always to that which is the unity, the mystery, the love which is behind all the many scenes that shine, as if each part of the illusion were a sequin sewn on to an almost unimaginably large structure or model for the delight and benefit of all, that all could walk around and behold the beauty of the illusion.”
