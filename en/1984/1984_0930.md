<p>… and we will once again express our gratitude. We shall leave you but our leaving is for the moment only and we shall return at any time we are called. We leave you, dear friends, in the love and in the light that shines ever brightly and gives a warm touch to us all. Adonai. I am Hatonn.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Jim channeling)</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and I greet you, my friends, in the love and in the light of our infinite Creator. It is our great privilege once again to speak through this instrument to this … We thank you for calling for our humble service and we are eager to share that which we may. As always, we shall attempt to answer those queries with our opinions and we remind you that such is the case.</p>
<p>May we begin then with the first query?</p>
<p><strong>J:</strong> Yes, Latwii, I’d like to know … <em>(Rest of question not transcribed)</em>.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my brother. Now do you think that we have such friends? Well it is not within our providence at this time that part which you have riddled but we shall be happy to inform you of what we may for we are aware of your great desire to know that which has recently occurred in your experience and you know of its nature. We of Latwii are not at this time, as you call it, of the inclination which takes its form in the craft of which you speak. It is our nature to join seekers who call our services to their presence in their meditative states. Many there are that we join unbeknownst to the conscious mind in meditation and in dreams. For this is the kind of contact which we feel most comfortable with even though we treasure the opportunity to speak through instruments such as this one. The entities inhabiting the path of which you speak also seek to join you in love, yet are of another higher density, though we are all one being.</p>
<p>May we answer you further?</p>
<p><strong>J:</strong> <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query my brother. We could give a name, but such would be an approximation of these entities’ vibratory <em>(inaudible)</em> for they have not chosen that which you call the name in their attempt to represent and glorify the one Creator. Therefore a name would not be appropriate.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my brother?</p>
<p>J: <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my brother. It would be possible for us to identify the <em>(inaudible)</em> were such an identity not in our humble opinion an infringement on free will. For if the identity of such a vehicle were known, it might persuade your thinking in a certain way which we feel would not be appropriate. It is, as we are aware you know, more appropriate to approach the mystery of this appearance in the meditative state so that those resonances of your deep mind which were touched by this spirit’s might be brought by your own seeking to the more conscious portions of your mind and used there as resources that might enrich or <em>(inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my brother?</p>
<p><strong>J:</strong> <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I am Latwii and we thank you, my brother, for allowing us to perform this service. May we attempt another query at this time?</p>
<p><strong>C:</strong> <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my brother. We find in this experience of this <em>(inaudible)</em> that a number of factors lend their color to what has affected your being and we shall attempt clarity if possible. There is within this dwelling the experience of illness which has occurred for a period of time and has become an energy of its own. Your recent experiences are a function of your increased sensitivity and when this increasing sensitivity is toward the vocal channeling without the requisite skill of inner tuning, then you find that whatever energies are present are easily sensed by your increasing ability to enter that which is called sleep trance. We might suggest for this particular type of service as a vocal channel that you determine a means of the tuning and challenging of an energy or entity which you sense in any manner and that you utilize this means of tuning and challenging so that you might express to the channel only those energies and entities that are of a positive and beneficial nature to those about you and to your own being as well. This type of tuning and challenging is also useful in the daily life, shall we say, where one has a time set aside, preferably before the day begins, to set the course, shall we say, that the entity shall attempt to follow for the day. A course that is built upon service and seeking and is illuminated by the light and love of the One dwelling in One. This means a ritualizing of the tuning may enhance your ability to use your increasing sensitivites in ways which shall assure a balance for the mind and the body and the spirit.</p>
<p>May we answer you further my brother?</p>
<p><strong>C:</strong> <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and this is <em>(inaudible)</em>, my brother.</p>
<p>May we answer you further?</p>
<p><strong>C:</strong> <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I am Latwii. We are honored by what you bring, to listen to your experience and shall always be available to the ball or to the string. May we attempt another query?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister. We find that your latter assumption is more nearly correct though there are also those energies which are attempting the healing.</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of <em>(inaudible)</em> and would respond by suggesting that in part it is correct, yet there are also other energies drawn to this light that are also within the healing. For there is both the call and the resistance to the call and only so much may be done when there is resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> On this particular subject, is there a way … <em>(inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister. We find that the suggestions which we have made to one known as C, if they are utilized, will permit that entity to enjoy the meditative experience within this group and within this dwelling without the discomfort which it has experienced this evening due to the lack of the challenge and tuning which would exclude the more unpleasant of the vibrations. We find within your illusion there is a great mixture of that which might be called the positive and negative, pleasant and unpleasant, light and dark within all portions of your illusion. For the creation which you inhabit is one which contains all these and to move that <em>(inaudible)</em> which you enjoy during this <em>(inaudible)</em> would be to move it from the One to the One. It is within the ability of each entity to cleanse its own being and the place in which it works and the place to seek and share <em>(inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Yes. <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister. We find that this group has utilized these things to be channeled, the visualization, for a great period of what you call time in the meditative meanings and we can only recommend an intensification of this <em>(inaudible)</em> so that there is a greater effort made to construct what might be called a wall of light. There could be the selection of inspirational music to be listened to, followed by a short period of singing or chanting, also to be followed by a period of prayer which is now utilized and then the recommendation made that each individual in the group utilize some personal form of tuning to be continued silently as the group tuning has been completed.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> I’m sorry to <em>(inaudible)</em> but I was thinking more of the <em>(inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister. We find that this dwelling shall be inhabited by the entity of which you speak and shall therefore have a certain coloration of the difficulty that will remain with it as long as the difficulty remains with the entity. We can therefore suggest that this particular room might be cleansed with the cut clove of garlic at each entrance point and this shall remain throughout the week and shall be changed and refreshed with a new clove at each entrance point each week just before the meditation is to begin. This procedure taken in consideration with our previous suggestion should provide a place of working which has the optimum ability to enhance those vibrations of seeking and sharing which characterize this group and serve as its great potential.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister. This is correct. May we answer you further?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Only <em>(inaudible)</em> question that I <em>(inaudible).</em></p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister. We find that your supposition has the beginning of truth, yet there is more involved. We can suggest that the bond which you share with the one known as Don has ramifications which are most difficult to elucidate but which can in the neophyte attempting magical ritual cause the opposite of that which is desired, that is, in your particular case there can be the removal of vital energy rather than the enhancing of such when the magical ritual is attempted in a situation which has the many layers of, shall we say, discordant characteristics which we find in this particular situation. We cannot speak to each particular characteristic but can suggest that the lack of physical energy on your part and the assault upon the mental/emotional energy of <em>(inaudible)</em> is of enough significance that the performing of the banishing ritual of the lesser pentagram is not recommended until those energy complexes have been replenished and the recovery of balance and energy has also occurred within the one known as Don with whom you share a bond that permits the transfer of pain to your <em>(inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we appreciate the opportunity to be a ghost instrument. May we attempt another query at this time?</p>
<p class="comment">(Pause)</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and as it appears that we have exhausted the queries for the evening, we shall leave this group, as always, in joy and shall before leaving remind each that the illusion in which you dance and have your being at this time is an illusion which contains the one Creator in each portion of your experience though it may seem from time to time that you inhabit a portion of the creation which has been unfortunately depleted of any love and light. We know that your experience is one which weighs heavily upon your minds and your hearts from time to time and is an experience which brings the tear and the pain. Know that your work in this illusion is that work which produces a fruit from such pain and from so many, many tears.</p>
<p>You exist within an illusion which has great benefit to such growth and production of fruit of allowing you to move in a darkness, in a forgetting in which it is not easily apparent that you are the one infinite Creator and that you gather the fruit of love with every movement of your mind, your life, and your experience. Yet that great virtue of moving within the darkness allows this fruit of love to be harvested.</p>
<p>It is also the great deterrent to your current enjoyment of the illusion. For it is difficult to feel and [be inspired] by a fruit which you cannot see, which you cannot taste. Yet, my friends, know that such fruit is gathered in each moment of your experience and is enhanced by your continuing desire to give that which you have for that which you cannot see.</p>
<p>We are those of Latwii, and we leave you in the love and in the light that ever lights your path and beams within your heart. Adonai. Adonai vasu borragus.</p>
