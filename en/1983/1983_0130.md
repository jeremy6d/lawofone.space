<p>I am Hatonn, and I am now with this instrument. We greet you, my friends, in the love and in the light of the one infinite Creator. We wish to speak a few words on what for you is indeed of great difficulty in your illusion, that being what you know as choice. You, as all entities, are free-willed in each thing. Each of your life situations is to you many different options of which you weigh and choose. Each entity’s choice becomes that entity’s responsibility. When your choice is made and the moment accepted, neither hate nor love the choice, but accept it for the moment. With each choice you are … with each choice take a step. Use your …</p>
<p>We are experiencing some difficulty in maintaining a good contact with this instrument. We would, as he requests, now transfer this contact to another. I am Hatonn.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Jim channeling)</p>
<p>I am Hatonn, and greet you once again through this instrument in love and light. To continue. As you make your choices in this illusion, you will find that each choice brings yet more possibilities for choice. You operate within this illusion in a manner which might be called trial and error, though we would de-emphasize the error aspect, for we do not feel that any choice can be error. Yet from your experience you may discern those choices which are less efficacious than other choices, but this discernment is only possible as you continue to make choice after choice. You will find that the experiences which you gather through the making of choices will offer you hints, shall we say, that will aid you in further decision making, so that the entity which is able to analyze through the use of the mind those experiences which it has encountered is then able to take the gleanings of this analysis with it in meditation, and is able to allow new thought forms and possibilities in thinking to occur within the being.</p>
<p>Then this entity is able to continue a process of evolution which you may simply call growth, as you continue to expand and grow in your ability to utilize your mind, your body and your spirit complexes in an ever-expanding understanding, if we may use this term, of the nature of your illusion. Then you will find a pathway which lies before you that becomes more and more distinct. For as you choose, you become more polarized, shall we say, by the choices you have made, and this polarization then becomes likened unto a momentum within your very being. The momentum of your choices to be of service, however you have chosen, then shows to the attentive entity the path which is most efficacious within each situation that it shall face in what you shall call your future.</p>
<p>Do not be afraid to choose, my friends. Do not fear that which is called the failure by many of your peoples, for there is in truth no such thing as failure. There may be instances wherein your choices shall not yield the results which you had hoped they would yield when you made the choices. Yet this is only a function of your imperfect understanding of what it is that will truly benefit your evolution in mind, body and spirit. Rest within the assurance that you cannot fail as you choose and choose and continue to choose the path which you travel. You do not understand the complete overview, shall we say, of your journey, for this is not the density of understanding. You operate within a forgetting that increases the value, shall we say, of the choices that you make and the path that you travel in your total beingness.</p>
<p>Therefore, forget you the fear of failure. Choose and continue to choose fearlessly then, knowing that each choice has the opportunity to teach. And if you will listen with your inner being, discern with your mind, and join the two in meditation, you shall lead yourself through your own choices along that path which is the most efficacious for the growth that you so earnestly seek at this time.</p>
<p>We would now attempt to close through another instrument, if possible. We shall now transfer this contact. I am Hatonn.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(A channeling)</p>
<p>I am Hatonn, and greet you through this instrument. We would speak but briefly in closing to give the reminder that if ever our presence is desired, all you need to do is ask and we shall be with you. Seek us out in your meditation. We are with you always. We shall leave you tonight in the love and the light of the one infinite Creator. Adonai. We are known to you as Hatonn.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Jim channeling)</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and greet you, my friends, in the love and the light of our one infinite Creator. What a privilege it is once again to be with you. We sincerely appreciate the opportunity which you extend by your invitation. We are always excited to speak to this group. This group has been our longtime friend, shall we say, and to join with friends is indeed an honor and a great joy. May we then ask if we might be of assistance by attempting to answer queries this evening. May we ask for the first query?</p>
<p><strong>C:</strong> I’ll try to get a question out of this, and try not to ramble too much, and try not to ask for anything specific. But of late I’ve been extremely nervous and confused and unable to make decisions. I can’t seem to distinguish what is the proper avenue to take to serve others around me. When I meditate on it, it seems that a feeling that no matter what the choice, I would be serving myself more than others. Could you talk to me about such a state of confusion?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and shall attempt to penetrate to the heart of your query, my brother. Within your illusion are many opportunities for learning. The greatest opportunities present themselves as what your peoples call the problem, the crisis, the trauma, for when things are going smoothly, my friend, what is being learned? Quite often, little of value. But look you then to the situation which presents the crisis. Within the self one seeks in such a situation to resolve the crisis. Yet if the crisis be of such proportions that the entity cannot put, shall we say, all the pieces together to complete the puzzle in one fell swoop, then the entity finds itself mired, shall we say, within the crisis.</p>
<p>To put it more properly, may we suggest that the crisis is within the entity, and the depths of the crisis begin to appear great. If you will look at any situation which might be called a crisis, any such situation has the ability to awaken the deeper portions of an entity’s being so that awareness is increased. The awareness is increased usually through what may be called the pain, the suffering, the tears. The trauma of the situation which is not resolved or balanced within the thinking of the entity experiencing it begins to carve out within the entity new boundaries of perception, new potentials for experience. As the entity consciously works with the catalyst of the crisis, the opportunities for learning expand, yet are often unrecognized as the entity continues the process of working with the catalyst. Confusions often occur as the entity attempts to make decisions that shall, it hopes, end the crisis.</p>
<p>There are various resources and forces within the deeper mind, as well as aid from those presences which you may call angelic or guides, which provide the entity with the impulse to resolve the situation in the most efficacious manner possible according to the entity’s chosen polarity. Therefore, the entity may find the, shall we say, easier solutions quite difficult to make, for the easier solutions are not always the most efficacious. The entity is provided with aid from the inner resources that allow it to make the most helpful choice according to the polarity which it has chosen. The situation of crisis, then, allows an intensive experience of choosing to continue along a certain path of polarity to the entity. The crisis is, shall we say, the cutting edge of consciousness. The entity may go in either direction, the service to self or the service to others. The more intensive the lesson, the greater the crisis, the more opportunity for learning.</p>
<p>Do not fear that you shall make the wrong choice, for no choice is final and each choice builds upon previous choices and will lead to yet further choices, so that the entire process may be looked upon as one which continues to provide the opportunity for increasing the polarity of the individual. As you move through this situation, attempt to view it as often as possible from what might be called a neutral situation or position. Perhaps within your meditation you may be able to remove yourself from the emotional colorations which lend to your confusion, and place your attention in a position which allows you to look down upon the situation, shall we say, and see yourself and all others within it as actors upon a stage. Look then to the dynamics of the movement and interaction. See that part which you play. Become the author of the script. Attempt to discover what potentials await your learning. What is the lesson that is being taught? How has it been learned? How might the learning be increased? Attempt to remove yourself periodically in such a manner so that you might gain an overview and a more full appreciation of the process which presents you with great opportunities for learning.</p>
<p>In such a discipline, then, your deeper mind and those entities which aid through it may be able to give you clearer guidance so that your choices might be more informed and effective. Attempt to remove yourself from fear and to remove fear from yourself, for this, like any emotion, only distorts that which is seen and experienced. Go forth in joy and confidence knowing that you have great opportunity to learn and to share the love and light of the one infinite Creator which seeks to be known in each moment that you experience.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my brother?</p>
<p><strong>C:</strong> No, thank you very much, Latwii. That gives me quite a lot to work with. Thank you.</p>
<p>I am Latwii. We thank you, my brother, for this opportunity to serve. May we attempt another query at this time?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, Latwii, I have a question and it has to do with my channeling. I was wondering if you could aid me at all in why I might be having difficulties in picking up a channel. At meditations now I seem to draw a blank even though the tuning seems to be well and I’ve been mediating daily, but I’m a little confused on why I’m drawing a blank.</p>

<p>personal origin. The concept itself is more clearly transmitted from Confederation entity to the instrument. Each process and transformation which the instrument opens the self to will require of the instrument that it increase its desire to be of such service and increase its willingness to be the fool, shall we say. Yet as these continual exercisings—or mental pushups as we may call them—continue to be offered to the instrument, the entity will find the ability to transmit Confederation philosophy is quite enhanced and the service which it wishes to offer is likewise enhanced.</p>
<p>May we answer in more depth, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> No, that will give me something to work with.</p>
<p>I am Latwii. We would simply comment at this time in response to both queries that it is often the plight and pleasure of the seeker to find the opportunities for increasing service and oneness to be presented in situations which provide the trauma, the doubt, the confusion, and the difficulty in perceiving clearly. This is the nature of any exploration into that which may be called the unknown. Rejoice, my friends, in your doubt, in your confusion, in your frustrations, and in your angers. For they are signposts which alert you to the fact that your seeking is increasing, and the opportunities for knowing the love and light of the one Creator are also increased.</p>
<p>May we attempt another query at this time?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I have none, but thank you for that last bit, Latwii.</p>
<p><strong>C:</strong> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p>I am Latwii. It has been a great privilege, my friends, to be with you this evening, even for what you might call a brief moment. All such gatherings are treasured by we who are known to you as Latwii. We cannot express to you our gratitude in the appropriate terms which would be understood clearly. We feel the appreciation within those who have had queries this evening for that which we have humbly offered in service. May we express, then, to each present the same gratitude increased manyfold, for you provide us with a great service by asking for our humble service. For each, we seek to know and to serve the one Creator who resides within each portion of the one creation, and by such offerings of service have you allowed us to increase our knowledge of the One Who is present in all. We shall leave you at this time in the love and in the light of the one infinite Creator. Be at peace, my friends. Go forth in joy, for yours is the great journey into unity. I am Latwii. Adonai vasu borragus.</p>
