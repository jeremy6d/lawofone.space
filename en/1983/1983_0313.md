<p>[I am Hatonn.] It is a great pleasure to speak to you this evening through this instrument, and we would, at this time, speak to you in parable.</p>
<p>When a child, young in years, wearies of walking, he has in your culture the opportunity of asking for a tricycle. Originally, this tricycle was a very tall wheeled machine known as a velocipede. Upon it, the adventurous young person would dare life and limb, for the front wheel was very, very tall, and the two rear wheels very small, and the element of skill and concentration and art was great. But now, those who desire that no risk be taken have offered to your culture not only the tricycle made of metal, off of which a child could conceivably fall and bruise himself, but also the soft plastic safety of the big wheeled tricycle that cannot fall over. Upon it the child cannot come to harm. Of course, the child cannot then risk himself or dare an adventure, except in imagination, but this satisfies those who keep watch over him and are concerned for his safety.</p>
<p>When a child reaches a certain age, if it is of an adventurous spirit, [it has the opportunity] to request a bicycle. The element of risk returns. The child can dare the many tricks and performances common to those who cry out, “Look, Ma, no hands!” and swerve around corners at breakneck speed. They are not going anywhere, these older adventurers, they are risking themselves. Eventually, the child becomes man or woman and uses whatever means of transport is available, towards some end. He clambers into a car or upon the bicycle or motorcycle because it is necessary to move from one point to another, and perhaps the adult no longer dares the risks for the simple adventure of it. For perhaps now the adult sees purposes that unfold as the life unfolds before each one.</p>
<p>Now, my friends, as adults, the risks, the journeys, and the daring are interior. And yet, still there are those who could condemn you to the spiritual equivalent of the big, soft, plastic, three-wheeled environment. All your risk in your journey would be in your imagination. It has not been the choice of this creation and of the Creator to offer to each co-creator with safety. Not the three-wheeled, low-slung vehicle, spiritually or otherwise. You are free to risk, to dream and to dare. You are also free to go nowhere, to go only to those places which have meaning within an illusion which is bounded by geography, physics and the demands of your physical body. Those who find little joy in their experience are often those who have, of their own free will, chosen to limit the degree of risk in their seeking.</p>
<p>Let us turn in our thinking to a parable given by another. In this parable there were two sons. One son took his inheritance and spent it foolishly and sinfully, according to the notions of that day. The other son remained safely with the family, taking no risks and making no obvious mistakes. Yet, when the prodigal son had been reduced to the lowliest job possible within that culture he fell upon his knees, and he realized that he had left a loving father and sinned against him, and he determined to ask of that father for the lowliest job in the household. He had risked and he had lost everything, and yet when he came to his father’s house, the father instead said, “My son who was dead is now alive. Rejoice! Prepare a feast and bring all of our friends to celebrate the return of one who has been gone, one who has been lost.”</p>
<p>The other son, peddaling carefully through life upon three low-slung wheels, adhering to his father’s orders, felt not love but jealousy, for he had missed his journey, he had taken no risks and he did not know his identity nor appreciate his son-ship to the father, and said, “My father, you never gave me a party. I’ve always done everything you told me to.” What could the father say? He looked at one son, who was foolish but brave, who’d come back loving and penitent, and he looked at the other son who measured every bit of service, and he could only say, “All that I have is yours. It has always been so, but cannot I give a party when your brother, who was dead, has come alive again?”</p>
<p>Each of you look into your heart and search out that which you measure, that which is low to the ground because you do not wish to risk a fall. Examine it carefully, my friends, because it may be an opportunity for you to enhance your journey. You seek to know the Creator, and you know that the nature of this seeking will be of a kind of return for you. Know that you have come from the Creator, and it is to that consciousness that you return. Therefore, must you not journey away in order to come back? Can you ever return if you do not set out? Whether it is a small thing, or a large, do that which is true to you, even if it is a mistake in actions. When it is due to fear that you will lose control over others or yourself, if often the intemperate and unwise choice, action brings about a catalyst that provides you with many mistakes, much learning, new understanding, and an ever abundant return to feast with the Creator in the kingdom where bread is of the spirit.</p>
<p>I would, at this time, transfer this contact. I am Hatonn.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Unknown channeling)</p>
<p>I am Hatonn, and I am with this instrument. We would like once again to greet you in love and in light and would only say a few words in closing. We would like to express our joy in being allowed to share our message with you, the message of the Creator, the simple one of acceptance and love. We would like at this time to transfer, if the one known as A would allow us to do so, for we feel that the contact is beneficial for her at this time. I am Hatonn.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(A channeling)</p>
<p>I am Hatonn, and I greet you through this instrument, once again, in the love and in the light of the one infinite Creator. We are pleased with the chance to have our thoughts spoken through this instrument, and we are glad to see her climb back upon the horse. We have enjoyed sharing our thoughts with you and hope that, in some ways, it can shed a new light for you, for in learning in this illusion, there are many ways to see a lesson, and the brighter the light, the easier it is to see the lesson.</p>
<p>We shall leave you now, as we came, in the love and in the light of the one infinite Creator. Adonai. We are known to you as Hatonn.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Jim channeling)</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and greet you, my friends, in the love and in the light of our infinite Creator. We are pleased, once again, to be called to your group. We rejoice with each of you at the honor of joining vibrations. Without further adieu, let us offer our service of attempting to answer your queries. May we begin with the first query?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Latwii, I am hoping you can help us with our Friday night meetings, and first of all ask how we are doing on achieving purity in our contact, for it is something we strive for as channelers.</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am aware of your query, my sister. We feel that the discussion which preceded this meeting is quite sufficient to allow the realigning, shall we say, of the policy to admit those who have some knowledge of the nature of the meeting gained by reading those books which have been prepared for such a purpose. We feel that those who are what you may call the core of this group, are well aware of the necessity for tuning carefully, and do indeed tune as carefully as possible when the tuning time draws near. Yet, when entities have lesser desire and knowledge for this type of experience enter your circle, then the circle suffers some de-tuning. We feel that to expose these entities to the material available as a prerequisite to joining the circle shows respect to the tuning of the circle. The old and new entities, and, indeed, in the new entities, is a portion of the initial building of that respect which shall aid the tuning and the purity of the messages received.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Um, I know this will really touch a lot on our free will decisions, but where was there a great deal of distortion in your message and in Hatonn’s messages in the past meetings, or is that too much on the free will?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. To give a complete answer to this query would indeed take from you the ability to discern that which is discernible to you. You have within your inner awareness and your intellectual capacities as well the ability to, shall we say, gain a feel for what transpires and for the nature of the messages as they are delivered. Look then to your own resources for the tools to make this discernment more readily available, my sister, and may we answer you further?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> No, thank you.</p>
<p>I am Latwii. We are grateful to you, my sister, and thank you for your care and desire. May we attempt another query at this time?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> I’m a little puzzled. When we have an intensive meditation and a new channel asks about the quality of channeling, the answer is usually fairly specific. What is the difference between that question and the one that I raised?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. In the case of the new instrument, there is genuine doubt as to the purity of the contact. In the case just queried upon, there is not such a pure doubt and the service to be most helpful is to reinforce that which is known, not by verification in a yes or no manner, but [by] coaxing that which is known forward [within the instrument’s mind.]</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> So, if A truly was in the dark, and really had no clue, then she would have been able to find out about the channeled source, is that correct?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. This is largely correct, my sister.</p>
<p>May we answer you further?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> No, no, I am just reminded of something Ra said once about how interesting it is that people ask so many questions that they already know the answers to. I guess we want confirmation. Thank you.</p>
<p>I am Latwii. We are very appreciative, my sister, to you, as well. May we attempt another query at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> I guess you want me to save the questions about things that have happened to me and the channel and Don for Ra, right?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. Our desires, my sister, are to serve in whatever manner is possible. We therefore ask if there is a way in which we might be of service?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Yes, there is, if it isn’t an infringement on free will, because I really don’t think I know the answer, and I would like to—all three of us—would like to have a Ra session soon. Two of the three of us are under the weather but feel that we can do it. Is that estimate of the situation accurate or would we be too low on energy, and therefore be taking too much of a risk?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and shall attempt response to this query, though the instrument has some doubts as to our ability to clearly transmit that which is available. We shall begin, with the instrument’s kind permission as he attempts to stand aside. We feel that your group has the requisite energy and harmony necessary for the conducting of a session with those of Ra. Though your group does have the deficit in certain areas at this time, well known to each of you, there is the ability to function in the metaphysical sense, which is the overriding factor in such sessions.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Since Jim is the power part of the triangle, is there some danger that the kidney problem might go on longer because he is expending physical energy and visualizing white light?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and I am aware of your query, my sister. We find that this entity shall be able to function as necessary without the further damage to those organs of the renal structure for it is not a portion of the healing process that will be called upon in the activity of which you have spoken.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Just one thing, it’s the only other thing that I could think of that wouldn’t infringe, for sure, for sure. Is there anything that can be done to aid either Jim or me in building ourselves back up, each in our own way, and becoming healed of the things that have been wrong with us so that we might be able to be more, regular in our sessions than just having maintenance sessions and having trouble again?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and to answer this query in the most helpful manner, we feel that we shall move from that which you may call the mechanical to that which we hope is the heart of your query, for there are those who are far more able than we to speak upon the mechanics and though there are also those who are far more able than we to speak upon the heart, we shall attempt this speaking. As you prepare yourselves to travel through your illusion, whatever the destination or purpose at the moment, to be most prepared to partake fully and to be of the greatest service at each moment one may look to the heart of love, and to see that love reflected in each moment is to know that one is prepared for all things.</p>
<p>As you look about you, and as you move with those about you, and as you dance with your creation, find the harmony of the moment. Find the means by which the love within may be shared with those about you. The dance of your illusion is most important, for it is an illusion that seems to lack love. The magic of the moment is to find that love, for it is in each moment. It is within your being. To dance with those in love and harmony is to be prepared to know the one Creator, and to serve each of its portions to your greatest ability.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> No.</p>
<p>I am Latwii. We thank you, my sister, and may we attempt another query at this time?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> If no one else has one, I’d like to ask one more unrelated. I can’t remember whether I saw it in the news or heard it in the paper or whether it was just—but there was a woman with muscular dystrophy or multiple sclerosis who felt that she had the right to die because the nature of her life was not such that she could be of service to anyone else, basically. There has been a movie made on the same subject. A man being a sculptor who could no longer sculpt. He wanted to have the right to be taken off the machines that were keeping him alive. What are the metaphysical implications of determining, while still conscious, to end an incarnation, no matter how benign the circumstances sound? One does have the tendency to wonder whether or not it is a suicidal thought, and if it is a suicidal thought, whether that might not simply be prolonging the lesson rather than the other way around. What are your thoughts on that, Hobson?</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and am most happy to respond, dear. We shall begin by removing the concept of the suicide, as your peoples call it, for we find it overlaid with emotional content that distorts. We shall, indeed, re-correct this instrument, we shall de- …</p>
<p class="comment">(Side one of tape ends.)</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Jim channeling)</p>
<p>I am Latwii, and we shall continue with the concept of desire or perhaps dedication. When an entity finds itself in an incarnation lacking in that desire and dedication to learn those lessons which it has chosen to learn, and lacking in such an extent that it in some way contributes to the ending of its incarnation in what might be called a premature manner, then it shall find as it reviews the incarnation so ended that there was indeed the lack of desire, and it shall then find within itself the desire to complete that which was left incomplete. Therefore, such an entity may find that the lack of desire in one incarnation shall be balanced by a rededication to those lessons not learned and that situation not well used, and shall, once again, enter an incarnation in which the situation and the lessons and the desire dance together to find that there is the learning of love.</p>
<p>And may we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Yes, just to finish up. The only variation on that theme, of course, is when there is a flat brain wave but the body is still being kept alive by allopathic means, you know, a heart machine, a lung machine, and all that stuff. At that point, pulling the plug seems to me to have no karmic, no anything—force—it’s just simply the acceptance of what has already happened. Would you like to confirm that, or could you comment on it?</p>
<p>I am Latwii and am aware of your query, my sister. Indeed, in most cases, this may seem to be so, yet, it cannot be stated unequivicably—we correct this instrument—unequivocally, that such is always so, for, as you know, there are no mistakes, and a random catalyst is less and less apparent to those entities now incarnated upon your planet. This is to say that the advent of those machines which you call the life-support systems may have use to some entities. It may be that some final, last portion of a lesson can be learned while utilizing such a machinery.</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> No kidding!</p>
<p>It may also be the case that there are no further lessons, therefore, the machinery is unnecessary. We cannot state which case applies without knowing these specifics. Each entity can look to the inner knowing for that information.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Well, can one really? I mean, there’s a poor dumb relative with a “living will” in her hand saying this is the “living will” stating her husband’s desire is to be unplugged, if he ever gets in this situation. How does that person know how to perform the best service?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. We repeat that there are no mistakes. You may do as you will in each case. There are always ramifications and results from action. That is the nature of action. When you review your incarnation you will undoubtedly find those situations which you had hoped might produce results other than were produced. This will give you the means by which you may refine the learning which you intended. It is not necessary, shall we say, that you measure up to a certain grade in each situation. Do not be overconcerned with the details of each situation that you encounter. Look instead to the overall basics that are developed and balanced, especially those concerning love, forgiveness, acceptance, understanding and compassion. If you begin with such considerations, you begin at the heart of your lesson, and it is the heart of that lesson that you seek in each tiny experience.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my sister?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> I would hardly consider the decision that would bring about the death of someone—clinical death—a tiny experience. I think I get the drift. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>I am Latwii. We thank you, my sister, and, indeed, we do not mean to call that which you call death a tiny experience, but we are speaking to the general tendency to look upon each experience as large.</p>
<p>May we attempt another query at this time?</p>
<p class="comment">(Pages 14 and 15 are missing from the original transcript)</p>
<p>tion that we are of the Creator, we, therefore, are of yourselves.</p>
<p>May we answer you further?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> No, thank you.</p>
<p>We thank you, my sister. Is there another question?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> Yes, just one other question, Latwii. These people who are living in these illusions different from ours from our point of view, who worked with them many years, they are irresponsible and someone has to care for them. They have to be literally taken care of as though they were helpless, and oftentimes they are very disruptive to everybody around them, in fact. And my question is, do these entities, when they are crazy, to use our word—it’s as good as any that I know—do they serve as a catalyst for those around them or do they give them an opportunity to serve the Creator?</p>
<p>I am Latwii. My sister, we would, if allowed, extend your question and respond by observing that those around oneself always have the potential of being both catalyst and the opportunity to be of service. There is no self who is not capable of being of service at any opportunity to another self.</p>
<p>May we answer you further?</p>
<p><strong>Carla:</strong> No, thank you.</p>
<p>We thank you, my sister. Is there another question?</p>
<p class="comment">(Pause)</p>
<p>I am Latwii. As there are no further questions, we will take our leave with the observation that this has been a ducedly good time. In the love and the light of the infinite Creator, my friends, we are known to you as Latwii.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>I am Nona. We greet you in the love and the light of our infinite Creator. We come at the request of one who is not present and one who is present. We are most grateful to offer our healing of vibrations through this instrument, in love and light and light.</p>
