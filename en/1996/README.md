> Group question: We would like to ask about discernment. We are aware that we know whatever we know through the intellect, through the experiences that teach us, and we know through intuition, through the subconscious mind, through any entity that might communicate through the subconscious to give us an indication of the rightness of a thought, direction or action. We are wondering how to find or discriminate the highest knowing, the best knowing, the way that we can act according to what we know that we are doing the best we can, both to know and to act? How much of this is dependent upon faith?

> Group question: From the Law of One information we have the statement from Ra that “It is the way of distortion that in order to balance distortion one must first accentuate the distortion.” We are wondering if this is done consciously or subconsciously. How does this work in the daily round of activities? How does this work with emotions? Can or should we attempt to control our emotions when we are attempting to balance catalyst?

> Aaron: I want to return to this aspect of your experiences as a balance between human with its physical body, which has aches and pains; its emotional body with its joys and sorrows; its mental body with its mix of clarity and confusion; and its spirit body. The balance is between this human expression and the ultimate essence of love that you are.

> Group question: We would like information on the concepts of being in a rut or accomplishing ritualized behavior for a specific purpose and expanding our horizons and learning new things. Our own subconscious, the High Priestess, seems to be the means by which we are led into new directions. Male and female relationships seem to be characterized by the female being more willing to learn new things, whereas the male is happy to be in a rut. So what we would like to know is the strengths and weaknesses of ritualized activity and expanding our horizons.

Almost everybody has some addiction. How do we work on addictions? What is the proper attitude to take with an addiction? Do you try to solve it, correct it, or accept it? How do you know that you are getting anything done when you work with an addiction? Is there any value in working with addictions or in addictions themselves?

> Group question: The question this afternoon deals with wanderers and the problems that they face. Ra mentioned at one point that wanderers were more likely to have psychological problems fitting in with the vibrations of this planet. We are wondering if Q’uo could speak about the kinds of difficulties that wanderers face that might be specific to them as opposed to the kinds of difficulties that natives of this planet might face, and special recommendations that Q’uo might have as to what wanderers might do to harmonize their situations.

> Group question: (The beginning of this transcript is missing.) … To that which one has hoped he would be. Yet, each daily dying is simultaneously the day of resurrection. As within the curtain of flesh, each capitulates in the daily cycle and in the yearly cycles of light and darkness the seasons of spirit. There is a revolving wheel of being that moves the planets in their courses and the hearts of men within its daily cycles and seasons; always moving, never still. Life and death tumble like puppies with each other, experiencing endlessly limitation, expansion, darkness, light, sadness, joy. And each emotion is a truth. How often have you met the resurrected Christ consciousness upon the road and not known that it was Creator.

> Group question: Our question this afternoon has to do with our tapes, our individual behavior patterns that we notice, hopefully, at some point in the life experience. They, we think, have something to do with what we are here to learn. And we were wondering if Q’uo could give us some sort of idea about how these behavior patterns work, how we set them up. Most importantly, how do we recognize them? And how do we begin to change them if we feel that change is a good thing to do?

How can we use the catalyst of each situation to partake in the balancing process? How can we be the best mirrors to people?

> Group question: We have a two part question. First, why Hatonn has been overshadowing our group and why Carla felt the need to challenge Hatonn a few sessions ago, and, secondly, could you give us the principle why the seniority of incarnation by vibration is in effect? It rewards those who have done spiritual work successfully but makes it more difficult for those who have not been successful. Even that which they have is taken away, and the lessons become more difficult. If you can’t do the first set of lessons well then it seems unlikely that more difficult lessons will be done well either. When we feel eager to grow and yet there are restrictions around us does that mean blockages from other lives or is that the nature of this illusion to have restrictions around one even when ready and eager to grow?

> Group question: The question this week has to do with the possibility that it might be as hard for service-to-others oriented people to accept the love offerings of others as it is to give love in service to others. In fact, many of us have the feeling that we like to be able to reciprocate in kind as soon as possible when somebody helps us out and gives us a helping hand because we want to be sure that we give more than we receive, that what we really want to do is to give. So, we would like to have some comments from Q’uo or anyone from the Confederation on giving and receiving and the importance of each, the difficulties of each, the advantages and anything you would care to say.

> Group question: Our question this week concerns the affiliation between the Yahweh entities and the Mars population that rendered their planet unliveable. Yahweh became like a shepherd or god and this seemed to open the door for negative balancing opportunities. A negative entity from Orion claimed to be the original Yahweh and made a covenant with them so if they obeyed his laws their enemies would be laid low by Yahweh and they would prosper. We are wondering if this covenant made with the Jewish race and perhaps the Arabs too was why Jesus made a new covenant focusing on love rather than the eye-for-an-eye nature of the old covenant, and we are wondering what Q'uo might have to say about that subject.
