> Q’uo: You ask us about the companionship of money and spirituality. It is written in one of your holy works that the love of money is the root of all evil. We would like to point out that it is the love of money, as it is any idolatry, which is at the root of separation, whether it be the separation of true worship of the great divine mystery because of pieces of wood and stone or the separation of one’s focus from that same mystery because of the love of counting. It is not the money itself which is contrary to a life led with a spiritual center, but the idolatrous love of that which is builded by man in imitation of the Creator’s abundance.

> Q’uo: Those things which we say are the best we have to offer through a particular channel at a particular moment, and we would not deceive you, thus we speak as truly as possible within the limits of spoken language. Yet each word has many meanings, each concept can be heard with many ears, many attitudes, and many predispositions. Those things which do not seen appropriate for your growth at this time must needs be left behind without a backward glance. The answers lie within you, not within us.

> Q’uo: The presumption of the seeker is that all parameters are to be understood and searched out and that there is trail of wisdom to the stars, a series of questions that will lead one to infinite wisdom. This is not so. Wisdom is born of suffering, dilemma, contradiction and pain. The so-called happy times that you experience within the illusion are useful as randomly as are the difficult times, and the intrinsic value of happiness is quite low.

> Q’uo: When you request information on enlightenment and appropriate methods for attaining it, you are speaking of attaining a manifestation rather than an essence, for enlightenment can only be seen by its reflection. Just as light itself is the creature and creation of love, so also is enlightenment the creature and manifestation of the thought of love which an entity has made his own.

> Laitos: We look upon the vocal channeling type of service as one which offers increasing kinds and depths of service to all those with whom the process is ongoing. We choose in these kinds of sessions to offer information which is more useful to the people, as you call them, that have joined in the session in order that they might serve as vocal instruments, rather than offering information which is more general in its application, for these workings are those which have been set aside for the purpose of developing the instruments which will at a later time, as you would see it, [move] into the kinds of service that will move to a wider selection of your peoples.

> Laitos: I am Laitos, and greet each of you again in love and light. We have been working with each instrument present as each needs and requests such assistance. We have found that with each instrument there is a firm foundation which has been built of desire to be of service to others, and this foundation has been elaborated upon by each present as experience in this way of service has been gained. Each instrument, then, upon the same foundation of desire to be of service to others, fashions a structure, a framework, a channel, if you will, through which our contact and other contacts may move. As each of you is unique in the makeup of what you feel is significant, in the life experience in general and in the spiritual seeking in particular, the form that your structure or channel takes is completely unique unto each of you. In this uniqueness, we take our joy, for we are through such individuality able to impress our message which is always and ever the same.

We have been working with the one known as K in anticipation that she might be open to the possibility of initiating a contact this evening. We may suggest to this new instrument that the faculty of analysis is, though still somewhat significant within this new instrument, that which is far less of a difficulty in this new instrument than in most. We would therefore commend this new instrument for its ability to allow the analytical portion of the conscious mind to be put aside temporarily. This is a general faculty which this new instrument has utilized far better than most and though it has at this working presented somewhat of a difficulty in the overall sense, we are very happy that this new instrument has taken so quickly, shall we say, to the reservation of judgment and analysis. At this time we should attempt to contact the one known as K, and will transfer this contact at this time. I am Laitos.

This is true for all instruments, in fact, for even with an instrument which has practiced its art for many of your years, there is the constant opportunity to expand such an instrument’s capabilities by presenting concepts of greater scope and, shall we say, intricacy, though we do not mean to suggest complexity.

We are again most honored to be asked to join your group this evening in order that we might, as is our way, work with a new instrument who seeks in her own way to be of service through the vocal channeling. As always, we remind the new instrument that while the contact is being sought, and while it is experienced, it is well to reserve analysis and judgment of process and content in order that both may move in their own way through the instrument and thus exercise it that it comes to know that vibration which signals the contact and that feeling of surrender that allows the contact to move through the instrument.

We are honored that another has chosen to learn the service of vocal channeling in order that it might serve as an instrument for our humble thoughts, for as each new instrument begins this process, we find ourselves in the joyous situation of having before us yet another opportunity not only to serve the Creator, and another who wishes our services, but to aid a new instrument in being of further service in its own life patterns.

> Q’uo: There are times in each seeker’s experience when the waters of life seem somewhat dammed up, and there seems to be the need for the guardianship of precious things. There is a sense that those things necessary to life must be conserved and guarded. This is the very purpose of the illusion which you have fashioned for yourself. Without the illusion, there would be no temptation to feel that one must guard what one has, there would be no experience of lack, thus there would be no fear of that lack.

> Hatonn: Our native home is the density towards which you now strive, the density of love, compassion or understanding. It is a density when lies are no longer necessary and masks may be tossed away, for our thoughts are all shared, and we accept and harmonize each other’s characteristics and seek together to be of service. Each of you has many impulses to live in just such a way, and we assure you that it will be your native land too when you have finished learning the lessons that you have set for yourself in this density of yours, the density of conscious awareness. Your density, my friends, must learn that consciousness has a certain characteristic which is its original characteristic. Consciousness is not a neutral thing, but rather sprang from a creative force, that creative force we call love.

> Q’uo: It is an interesting unity that all your energies make together, and we shall pause from time to time in our message in order to align ourselves with the shifting nuances of the group unity as it is more subtle than most within the harmony of those who seek. And perhaps it is to that diversity in unity that we would speak this evening, for although love is always the same and the one original Thought remains the mystery that it always has been and always shall be to the conscious rational mind, yet the codes of perception of this one original Thought of love are many and varied, not only from person to person, but in each person from moment to moment.

We would perhaps agree that there is more than chance to the universe, its creation, administration, and creative embroidery. Perhaps we would all agree that the most important force in each personal life experience has been love, the love that creates and the love that destroys, the love that gives and the love that takes.

And when you move within your daily round of activities, you are utilizing but the tiniest fraction of that which is at your disposal. Yet that very movement itself draws unto your limited self more and more of that which knows no limits in order to enhance your ability to experience within your illusion. Thus, we speak as we have spoken, of limitation and infinity being recapitulated within your own being and of this process being fueled by your will to seek and your faith that the seeking will bear fruit.

> L/Leema: I am L/Leema, and I greet you in the love and in the light of the one infinite Creator. We greet each of you with great affection and thank you for calling us to your group this evening for it is your service to us to allow us to share our humble thoughts with you. And yet, you must know that in some degree we too are channels, and we pray, as does this instrument, that our words may have not only the meager understanding of our experience, but the inspiration of those who are our teachers as well, for are we not all channels of the one infinite Creator? And as we speak, do we not listen? And as you listen, does your heart not speak? We ask you these questions because the question has been asked of us, “What is the place of analytical thought upon the spiritual path of seeking the truth?”

> L/Leema: I am L/Leema. We greet you in the love and in the light of the one infinite Creator and thank you for calling us to you this evening to consider the question, “What is the meaning of life?” This is not an inconsiderable question.

> L/Leema: I am L/Leema. I greet you in the love and in the light of the one infinite Creator. It is a privilege to have been called to your group this evening, for although none in the circle but the instrument had a question, this instrument has a pressing question and to this we shall address ourselves. The question this instrument believes it is asking is, “Am I a Christian?” However we shall approach the answer in a way unexpected to this instrument.

> Hatonn: There is within the heart of each of you, my friends, a pathway. There is within the heart of each of you, my friends, a home. These are one and the same. Very often because of your illusion the seeker believes that the journey he is on is of a certain nature which among other things leaves him homeless. This has been the description of the seeker’s quest in many a spiritual metaphor—the road that stretches ever onward, the straight and narrow path, the craggy mountain trail, the dangerous, rock-strewn road, the endless desert. As these are all aspects of your own selves, these are aspects of the journey upon which you have set out by choice and from which you shall not return, therefore some feel homeless and others who know that they are in an oasis, comfortable, surrounded by support and love, almost feel as if they have left the path.

> Latwii: My friends, we would speak to you about something somewhat seemingly different than the usual topic of love and meditation. We would speak to you of expenditures. The questions that bring you to a metaphysical group which is seeking the truth are basic. You wish to know who you are, you wish to know why you are here, you wish to determine where you are going. And somehow, philosophy often neglects that which may be called daily or ordinary life, expecting and hoping that the seeker will experience that more and more of the consciousness will be taken up with these deep and impenetrable matters so that as the life experience grows longer, the seeker will become closer and closer to the infinite mystery of the source of all that there is.

> Hatonn: This evening we would speak upon the topic of harmony, using the experience of this group this evening as a starting point, for though the topics of which you spoke upon were little concerned with matters spiritual, it was the desire behind the topic, shall we say, that allowed the work of blending vibrations together in a harmonious manner to occur.

> Hatonn: As you know, no matter what our subject may be, we are speaking of some aspect of a life lived in love, and we would choose this evening to speak to you of the art of hope.

> Laitos: My friends, we are pleased to speak to you tonight, for this is an occasion which we of the Confederation find beneficent for your planet. For we approach that time in which many of your planet celebrate the memory of the events of the life of one whom you call Jesus the Christ. We celebrate with you the efforts on the part of many to turn inward, to use this occasion as an opportunity, a stimulus to turn within and examine oneself, to reunite oneself with one’s Creator, for in truth, my friends, is this not the significance of that which you call the resurrection?

> Oxal: We would speak with you this evening of joy, that quality which is beyond its name, that energy which creates in fire and yet in peace, that explosion which is yet a steady state, that translation of that which proceeds into that which is.

> Hatonn: As the night sky opens, and as you come together in circle this evening, we find that there are questions upon some of your minds concerning a certain aspect of love which has to do with the interaction of entities who wish to express love for the Creator and to each other.

> Hatonn: As you look up at the stars, my friends, that which you see is inconceivable. Indeed, before your so-called science developed instruments capable of measuring and classifying that which the eye sees when gazing at the night sky, the majority of the inhabitants of your planet felt that they lived inside a dome through which there were tiny holes and therefore through which at night the great light beyond the sun could be seen. You are dwelling at this point in your experience within a physical vehicle which is inconceivable. Yes, my friends, you are very used to your bodies and therefore do not find them astonishing. Yet could you, without seeing a form, develop the intricate system of, shall we say, the most primitive internal combustion which is your body? The universe of man is a universe in which those things which are the true mysteries are often those things which are most taken for granted and unexplored while man turns his excellent mind to the creation of artifacts of his own making.

> L/Leema: We shall speak tonight of the positive, the negative, and the neutral; of the proton, the electron, and the neutron; of serving, of receiving, and of being.

> Hatonn: We spoke of doubt at the beginning of this contact and we would choose at this time to expand somewhat upon this concept, for if what we have just spoken has truth within it, then it must be asked by any seeker of that truth what part doubt plays and why it seems many times that doubt plays such a large part within the process of seeking and experiencing that each of you and your fellow beings experiences in your daily life.

> Q’uo: We would speak with you this evening upon love. It will not seem at first as if we are talking about love, for what we wish to do is gaze with a clear eye at what many among your peoples call phenomena. The more obvious of these phenomena are those so-called occult arts of astrology, Tarot, and those who work within the trance state in inner level work as opposed to the work with those influences which are external to your planetary sphere.

> Monka: There are many questions upon your mind at this time about not just the correct way to live, for this in itself has almost no meaning, as correctness is different for each individual, but rather the most spiritually propitious way to join in community and to relate to each others within a society.

> Hatonn: I am Hatonn, and am privileged to greet each of you this evening in the love and in the light of our infinite Creator. We are most happy to be with you this evening, and offer our services in a joint effort in seeking the One who resides behind all mysteries of being. We thank you for inviting our presence this evening, and thank you doubly so for inviting the opportunity to exercise both instruments in the telling of a story. We delight in the sharing of our humble opinion by means of the story, for in such a manner may we point a direction with less chance of seeming dogmatic upon any point, for with the story comes the opportunity for each individual to interpret the story in an unique fashion, a fashion which shall have the most meaning and impact to that entity and to each so listening.

> Hatonn: As the seeker gazes down at the dusty road, at the dust that lies upon his feet and covers his sandals, he may well doubt that road and doubt the security and the promise of the journey of seeking. The staff which is intended to aid may become heavy and even those few belongings which the seeker has to carry with him begin to seem a great burden. And so the seeker sometimes removes himself from the dusty path which seems to go on forever. The seeker moves into a beautiful valley, well-watered and forested with pastures where spring the small animals and where the sweet flowers bloom.
