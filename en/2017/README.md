> Group question: Some people may have passions, desires, or goals, that are difficult to directly relate to service to others. Is pursuing these things that don’t seem to directly serve others a self-serving act, or can we relate to these types of passions on the positive path?

## [December 2, 2017, Saturday Meditation](en/2017/2017_1202)


> Group question: Today we’d like to talk about the concept of conformity and non-conformity. Ra said that the adept is one which has freed itself from the constraints of thoughts, opinions, and bonds of other selves. Q’uo has said that the spiritual path is very personal and individual. However, it seems as though we need to be able to understand and relate to others, and them to us, in order to serve them effectively. Can you please discuss this dynamic between conformity and non-conformity on the spiritual path of service?

> Group question: Q’uo, Ra describes wisdom as having two faces—a positive and a negative face. Could you elaborate on what constitutes both positive wisdom and negative wisdom? Also, can you speak to how the positively oriented seeker might avoid the pitfalls of negative wisdom, and move into positive use of wisdom?

> Group question: What are the proper roles and balance of the analytical and intuitive minds on a path of mystical seeking?

## [October 7, 2017, Saturday Meditation](en/2017/2017_1007)


> Group question: Q’uo, we feel we live in times that are intense, complex, confusing and distracted. It can create a prohibitively foggy environment for the awakening spiritual seeker. How do those further ahead on the path of seeking turn back to assist those beginning their first steps in this sort of environment. What is it that the more seasoned seeker may share with the presumably younger seeker?

> Group question: The Confederation has helped us see our world as a place where all is well—all that happens is meant to be and that there are no mistakes. On the other hand, offering forgiveness is stressed, and Ra has said that in forgiveness lies the stoppage of the wheel of action, or what you call karma. This seems like a paradox in that if one accepts and understands that there are no mistakes and all that happens is meant to be, what would there be that would need to be forgiven?

## [September 3, 2017, Homecoming Meditation](en/2017/2017_0903)


> Group question: We have been told that this is a time of harvest for Earth, and that those few desiring a service-to-self harvest should not be denied the opportunity to achieve their choice. As a person who prefers the service-to-others choice, what encouragements or thoughts can you offer concerning my reactions to, and especially, my thinking about, the fighting and riots in some of our cities. I don’t want to be angry, I don’t want to hurt others with what I say. How can I remain focused on what is positive when some events seem to go absolutely contrary to what I believe?

> Group question: Most within the group have felt various layers of clearing as old things are let go and openings are made for new energies and opportunities. There is a common desire to raise the self’s vibrations to their highest potentials, and to be more effective in serving others. We would like to know how we can both work with and allow the energies of fourth density to clear and transform us; and what, if anything, we can do to consciously assist this process of clearing. Also, if you could speak to the role of gratitude in this process.

> Group question: If we look at our daily experiences as giving us clues as to the direction of our seeking, how should we use our feelings, our intellect, and our intuition to choose our direction?

## [April 30, 2017, Special Meditation](en/2017/2017_0430)


> Group question: We would like to explore the impetus which moves us toward service to others. We have noticed that in many situations we find ourselves moved to service through a sense of discomfort or unease in witnessing the suffering of another self, and performing a service offers us relief from this discomfort. Is it the best service if it is motivated by seeking not to witness the pain of another self?

## [April 15, 2017, Saturday Meditation](en/2017/2017_0415)


> Group question: Ra says, “The mind/body/spirit complex is not a machine. It is rather what you might call a tone poem.” Can Q’uo elaborate on what Ra meant by calling the self a tone poem? What does seeing ourselves as a tone poem reveal about our truer nature? Additionally, how is the harvest affecting our tone poem-like natures—whether the harmonic relationship with ourselves, with others, or with Planet Earth?

> Group question: The topic of our question today is about the process of traumatic death, especially those brought about by a war. Can you please tell us how those who experience such a traumatic passing are ministered and guided in their healing process from the other side, how we can participate and aid in that process, and how we can relate in balance and forgiveness to the aggressors who cause the traumatic events?

> Group question: Ramana Maharshi said that all that is needed to realize the self is to be still. Much value is placed upon stillness in enlightenment traditions, including your own message. What does stillness mean? What is the importance of stillness? How does one become truly still?

## [March 4, 2017, Saturday Meditation](en/2017/2017_0304)


> Group question: Our question today comes from our friend, Lana, and references two previously read quotes from Ra, and her question is: “I am confused about the sequence of activity and focus here.  Should the spiritual seeker focus on the Creator, unity, love, light, and joy first, and only afterward focus on clearing the blockages in lower energy centers and balancing the self? This is confusing because Ra seems to indicate that lower-center blockages will impede efforts to seek the Law of One on one hand (15.12), yet indicates on the other hand that the Law of One should be put first (52.11). Can you clarify?”

> Group question: In the Law of One, Session 4.20, it states: “The Law of One, though beyond the limitations of name, as you call vibratory sound complexes, may be approximated by stating that all things are one, that there is no polarity, no right or wrong, no disharmony, but only identity. All is one and that one is love/light, light/love, the Infinite Creator.”

> Group question: Several of us in the group are struggling with the world which seems to judge or reject us so often, whether it’s about our past, our choices, our spiritual beliefs, or some other aspect of our lives. We feel comfortable with ourselves in those things, but feel uncomfortable or hurt when met with judgment or rejection from others. It can also lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. How can we relate to this catalyst of discomfort or hurt feelings? How can we find a place of comfort within ourselves which can withstand pressures from society, and how can we cope with feelings of isolation brought by our choices, beliefs, or experiences?
