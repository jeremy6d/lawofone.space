> Group question: This week, in the spirit of the season that we are entering, we would like some information on the entity that we know of as Jesus the Christ, Jesus of Nazareth. We would appreciate any information about this entity or his incarnation very much.

> Group question: Q’uo, our question today concerns the eternal present moment. A human author urges us to access the power of now. He states that in the present, suffering cannot exist because suffering depends on time. We are told, time and time again, that time is an illusion. So we would like to know what exactly is the “power of now”? How can we gain access to that power? How can we live more and more in the moment? How can we realize that we are creatures of the moment? What does the present moment look like to one that has discovered it? What results can be expected in a seeker who indeed has discovered the present moment?

> Group question: Our question today concerns free will. We would like to know what Q’uo could tell us about maintaining free will and why free will is the first distortion of the Law of One. Why not the second or third distortion? Why did the Creator of all things feel that free will was the most important of the distortions in order to be listed first?

> Group question: The question today has to do with fear and love. We are assuming that fear and love are on a spectrum of … there’s a connection between them and we would like Q’uo to give us some information about how we can deal with fear, any kind of fear. Fear of doing something we haven’t done, the fear of doing something that seems difficult. V mentioned that focusing on the love aspect tended to make the fear dissipate. Is that correct? Is there anything else we can do to deal with the fear when we feel that it’s taking too much influence in our lives?

We’ve gone around the circle today and we’ve shared a lot of very intense, interesting, involved and complex information dealing with personal lives, opening the heart, and , new directions, and we would like Q’uo to take a look at these energies, look at our hearts and speak to the concerns that are foremost in our own spiritual journeys.

> Group question: Our question today has to do today with mated relationships. We would like Q’uo to give us some information that might give us a better idea as to the potential of a mated relationship. What difficulties might one expect in entering into a mated relationship? What kind of attitude is most helpful in dealing with the difficulties? Please add anything else that might be of use or interest concerning mated relationships.

> Group question: We thank the one known as T for requesting this time of asking and we are most happy to share our opinions with the request that, as always, all the things we have to say be carefully reviewed and examined for their helpfulness to you personally. For many things are interesting but there are those few things which are indeed yours by that internal and intuitive process of discrimination that the spirit has for those things which impinge upon its evolution. There is a resonance to those things that fit into that subjective search for the truth that is ever and always the same. If this can be done then we may feel free completely to share our opinions as what they are, mere opinion, those thoughts of a friend rather than those great teachings of some authority.

> Group question: The question today has to do with change and how we respond to change. We’ve talked around the circle today and it’s the common theme for everyone that there have been a lot of changes. And as we look at the situation in the world today, we see rapid changes, some of them violent, drastic and catastrophic. We were wondering if there is a particular response to change that could be recommended? We are forming a community. It seems to be a very good thing to do in the way of providing support and inspiration and encouragement and reinforcement to individuals. People seem to have a way, whether they live together or talk together at work, of sharing their energies and lending their support to each other. Could you talk to us about change and community and the best way to respond to change?

> Q’uo: [Everything,] the body, the sound, the music of life, the color of it, all of these things that fill in the colors and the shapes and the form of consciousness: all of these things exist as vibration.

> Question from G: How may I be free of my own self-created prison walls and free of the resulting pain that keeps my energies internal and my heart, that wants to connect, so distant from others? How may I be free to love, to love at will, and free to channel love as universally and unconditionally as did the one known as Jesus?

## [May 25, 2003, Sunday Meditation](en/2003/2003_0525)


> Group question: The question today has to do with the concept of free will, as regards to how the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the One Creator has related to the population of planet Earth for as long as there has been a relationship. Considering all the dirty water, the dirty air, and the nuclear proliferation, warfare, disease, poverty and so forth that are rampant upon our planet now, especially after the graduation of the Harvest, we are wondering, are there any circumstances under which the Confederation of Planets would consider abridging free will and stepping in and cleaning up the air, cleaning up the water, destroying nuclear weapons, providing food and services for people that need it? Or is there some other consideration that we should think about? We would appreciate anything Q’uo has to say on that topic.

> Group question: Our question this week has to do with how we can maintain our spiritual centers in our desire to seek in a spiritual sense, when there are so many things in the world around us to which it seems to be necessary for us to pay attention in a very focused fashion, whether it is the children that we are raising, the family to which we are relating, the job that we are working, or the friends with whom we wish to interact. We would like any information Q’uo could give us about how to maintain this balance between the worldly things that seem to take so much of our time and attention and the spiritual things that we have to work so hard to make time for.

## [May 11, 2003, Sunday Meditation](en/2003/2003_0511)


> Group question: We’ve had a general discussion that has touched on several key topics, the focus of which is that self-acceptance seems to keep coming back to center stage, regardless of what one thinks its importance level is. As one moves further along the spiritual path it continues to be the ultimate focus. Now, we also had a brief discussion about what it truly means to be a mature soul and how that involves loving yourself and thinking for yourself and not going along with mainstream consensus. So, with this as our basic background of discussion, we’ve decided to leave this session open to the forces to take in whatever direction they see fit for our mutual good.

> Group question: The question today, Q’uo, is please expand on the difference between serving and pleasing. It is mentioned in the [L/L Research] transcripts many times but it is mentioned as though we should already know what they’re talking about. So we appreciate your giving us the difference between serving and pleasing.

> Group question: The question today, Q’uo, has to do with what it seems like a lot of people are feeling these days, because the United States is engaged in a very destructive war with Iraq, and times just seem like they’re full of stress. There’s more to do than there’s time to do. A lot of people are feeling sadness, anger, frustration and doubt. These things just seem to come bubbling out. We’re wondering if there is a way of maintaining one’s harmony in such times; if there is a way of dealing with these difficulties that will bring us back to harmony? We appreciate anything that you might have to say about how we can deal with the difficult times that are within us and about us.

> Group question: The question today has to do with how light seems to respond either to impending catastrophe or out and out catastrophe. So many people are marching for peace, now that it seems war is so likely. The women in Rwanda have had a chance to bring the feminine principle and the nurturing of their being into their country now that the men have been killed, pretty much. It almost echoes the veil between the consciousness of conscious mind, and the possibility for two paths, whereas before there was just positivity.

> Group question: The question today has to do with, what we, as we talked around the circle perceived, as an increase in the level of energy, the tension, the intensity, the amount of things and difficulty that people are going though. And we had the idea that maybe what’s happening for people now is they are reflecting this increased energy by having whatever catalyst [that] is ready to come up in their lives come up—whether it’s getting out of one relationship and into another or transitioning from one place to another, one life to another. We’d like to have some information on whether this might be a correct perception. Any type of elaboration on this topic would be appreciated as well.

> Question from B: The question today has to deal with the concept of empowerment and enslavement that Q’uo mentioned in the last session. We are aware of how enslavement in various kinds occurs through governments, military and so forth, but what we would like to know (inaudible) empowerment might even be found in the very DNA that we contain, that would help us to realize our life’s goals of serving and of learning, and we were wondering if Q’uo can give us some information about how a person can achieve this empowerment, and what was Q’uo talking about when empowerment was mentioned in relationship to the enslavement. In addition, we would like to know something about what the empowerment in the DNA might actually look like.

> Group question: The question today has to do with the concept of self-acceptance. It seems that every seeker of truth at some point needs to be able to accept the self as completely as possible in order to progress in the seeking. It seems like many of us, in order to increase the compassion in our lives, have programmed a lack of compassion for the self, being service-to-others people, and this gives us constant opportunities to accept the self when we fall short of our goals.

> Group question: The question today has to do with the grid of our planet as we are moving from third into fourth density. We are assuming that there are points on this grid that are in need of some attention, some sort of focusing energy which we would like to be able to do, in our meditative state and maybe even in general, just the way we are able to live our lives to produce compassion or love or mercy or forgiveness in our daily round of activities. We would like Q’uo to give us some sort of an idea about how we might be able to be of service in this respect; in strengthening the grid, the road to fourth density from where we are in our daily round of activities in dealing with the catalyst of the day, with our own distortions, with our desire to serve and our feeling like sometimes it’s just too much.
