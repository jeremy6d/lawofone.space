> Group question: The question today has to do with the topic of psychic greetings. Many people look at just about anything that happens to them which is of what they would call a negative nature as a psychic greeting or a way of negative entities interfering in their spiritual growth. We are wondering if Q’uo could give us some information about how to determine whether or not our experience is of a psychic greeting nature. Does it matter if it is, in our overall spiritual growth? And is there anything, a ritual, a procedure, that we could use to balance the psychic greeting?

> Group question: The question today has to do with the relationship between love and fear. We are told that there is a relationship and that if we can learn how to [find the] balance in this relationship, that we can help love to overcome fear. Could Q’uo tell us the relationship between love and fear?

> Group question: The question today has to do with breaking our forms and our rituals when it seems appropriate in order to let in the light better, shall I say. We are wondering if Q’uo could give us some guidance as to how to recognize when this is appropriate or how to, shall we say, roll with the punch when it seems inevitable. We are aware that, even when times and things don’t look like they’re working out the way they should and they seem to be totally askew, that all is well and all is perfect. How can we see that and how can we find a path that isn’t so deleterious to our own journey, sabotaging ourselves? Somewhere in there, Q’uo, I’m sure you could find something to talk about!

> Question from A: After a year of marriage I must admit my wife and I have a serious sexual problem. Without infringing upon the principles concerning free will, could Q’uo please comment on our current sexual difficulty? Could they confirm for me that my current situation has been planned by my higher self for guiding me in the positive direction? Aside from our personal problem, I wish to ask the difference between our spiritual evolution with and without sex. There are many monks or nuns who concentrate on their discipline in chastity. The Bible also has said, “For there are some eunuchs which were so born from their mother’s womb, and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of man, and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of Heaven’s sake.” He said that is able to receive it, let him receive it, Matthew 9:12. On the other hand, Ra taught us that a healthy sexual intercourse strengthens our vital energy and emotional energy with each other.

> Group question:  The question this week has to do with the roots of the concept of what we call “terrorism,” the attempts by a small group of people to gain that which they feel is their due and to gain it by violent means. We were referred back to the Biblical story of Sarah and Abraham where Abraham was unable to bear a child because Sarah was barren. He went in to Sarah’s maid-servant, Hagar, who was Egyptian, and she bore him a son, Ishmael. Fourteen years later, when Abraham was 100, Sarah was blessed by the Lord God at that time to have a child who was named Isaac. These two were the children of Abraham but only Isaac achieved the inheritance. Ishmael was left to wander into the desert and to form the tribes of what we now call the Arabs. And it is the battle between the Arabs and the Jews that seems to be so violently apparent in our world today. So we were wondering if Q’uo could give us a philosophical background of this type of energy and how it can be resolved upon our planet Earth today.

> Group question:  Today, Q’uo, our question has to do with how we might be able to determine, perhaps even define, our spiritual path through our daily round of activities. As we’re immersed in all the things that we do during our regular days, it’s so easy to get lost in the details and the ups and downs. Could you give us some little way or a shorthand way of reminding ourselves who we are and what we’re doing, of how to find our way through the maze and to make a spiritual sense of it all?

> Group question:  We’ve talked a lot today about change: physical changes in our circumstances, moving to new residences, emotional changes, finding out a lot more about our deeper selves, spiritual changes, and learning to experience the world around us in new ways on new levels. We know that the Earth is going through a lot of change, also, and as beings on a path of service, we would like to know how best we can serve Earth as she’s going through her change.

> Question from G:   would like to ask that you touch upon my desire and seeking to heal myself and my past, specifically delving into my search to discover the unknown traumatic learning and the primary cause of self-rejection developed within my formative years, the still-divided energies I feel within, and the hole I’ve described to you within my being, somewhere. Please feel free to leave these subjects and venture into any other topic you feel may be of benefit to me. I trust you. After which I’ll have as many questions as you and the instrument have the time and energy for. Thank you.

> Q’uo: We are those known to you as the principle of Q’uo, and we greet you in the love and in the light of the one infinite Creator, in Whose energy we come and in Whose service we are. It is our distinct privilege to be called to this circle of seeking and we thank each entity here for taking the time away from a very busy and tension-ridden life to stop a minute and just ask for the truth, for those things to come in that you hope will be resources and assets as you face the present moment. It is truly a present moment that is fascinating and challenging in many ways. And we are most glad to be here with you.

> Group question: Today, Q’uo, we have an interest in a couple of areas that might have a relationship. The first one we were talking about was the mirroring effect. In third density, since we have the veil of forgetting and aren’t consciously aware of exactly what it is we’re trying to do in our personal learning, each of us here is able to take advantage of the mirroring effect, where people reflect back to us that which we are attempting to learn. We’re wondering if Q’uo could give us a bit more information about just how this works? Can we consciously affect the way we mirror to other people? Should we even try?

## [May 2, 2004, Sunday Meditation](en/2004/2004_0502)


> Group question: The question today has to do with catalyst and determining what our catalyst is. We would like to have some information upon how we can determine what it is that is catalyst in our life and what we should be focusing on. The second part of the question has to do with the way catalyst can be processed: when it is successful, it seems as though the success comes from being able to look at the catalyst with a light touch; being able to look at it as catalyst and develop a certain sort of tolerance and patience with it as you work with it. And catalyst which has gone awry, as Ra said, tends to cause in us the feelings of frustration and anger and doubt and depression. So we would like for Q’uo to give us a bit of information about how to stay on the track where we develop the qualities of tolerance and patience and how to avoid the frustration and anger.

## [April 18, 2004, Sunday Meditation](en/2004/2004_0418)


> Group question: Our question today has to do with the purpose of third density. As entities are graduated from the second density, where the way of being is the group mind, they come into third density with the opportunity of individuating, of developing an individualized consciousness that will be able to aid its own evolution by the choices that it makes, free will choices, and we would like Q’uo to give us information about how this individuation then will lead into another kind of group mind, a social memory complex, and maybe a little bit of information about how the group mind of second density differs from the social memory complex that we’re moving towards as the result of the individual choices that we make in the third density. So could Q’uo give us a kind of overview of how this all works, of how the nature of the choice, the intention behind the choice, where does the metaphysical or magical personality come in here? We would appreciate anything you could tell us about how third density works.

> Group question: The question today deals with change. We were talking around the circle about the different kinds of change that each of us is going through. It even seems that the Earth and the solar system and perhaps the galaxy are going through changes as well and it would seem to be the logical thing, considering all things are moving and growing. We are wondering if Q’uo could give us some information today on how we, in our own personal lives, can deal with change. It seems that whenever we want to change or when change faces us, that there is a practical side and an idealistic side to the change: things that we would like to do and things we feel like we have to do. Blending the two or balancing the two seems to be the real trick. So if Q’uo could talk to us some about how to look at the concept of change in both the practical and idealistic senses, we would appreciate that very much.

> Group question: Q’uo, today we’ve been discussing the interaction and relationship between the universe and the seeker. We would like you to discuss how it is that the universe answers the seeker’s questions of identity, service and transformation and how it is that the seeker can best listen for, respond and know those answers that the universe offers. Additionally, what do these lessons teach of patience and how may we invoke and implement that quality in our lives?

> Group question: The question today has to do with change, perhaps even change to the point of self-healing. We are wondering if Q’uo could talk to us about the decision-making process that goes into this type of change. Could you explore the concepts of honor and duty and how discovering what our honor and duty in a certain situation is might help us to make the choices that would lead to this change and perhaps healing ourselves, finding a direction to be of service to others?

> Group question: The question today has to do with changes of various kinds, whether it’s changing a job or attitude or invoking a new presence of joy, peace and harmony. When we attempt these changes, when we make efforts in the third-density illusion to bring these changes about, we’re wondering how we can know if we’re being successful? Is there a predetermined path or way made for us already, or is this a choice we make from moment to moment totally of our own free will? How can we know if we’re exactly on the beam or not?
