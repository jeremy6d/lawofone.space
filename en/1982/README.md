> Hatonn: We have been enjoying your friendship, the love you have shared. We have been watching at this time of year you call Christmas. The love that has been shown upon your planet is great indeed. For as the time of harvest grows nearer, my friends, more and more of your people will come to know of the love and light of the infinite Creator. It is ones such as yourselves that dare to let the light shine that is within you and to draw others to the light, to what we believe is the path, the shortest path to the final goal of the one original Thought.

> Hatonn: When we speak of love, we speak of something exceedingly simplistic. That is, one thing from which all depends. The one original Thought of the infinite Creator has been called logos and love and we say to you that you may find it in diverse places, in all manner of situations (inaudible) in the sanctity and peace of your conscience or in the noisy humdrum of the daily routine.

> Hatonn: We are so pleased to be called back to your group again, to share in your joy and to listen to your joyous sounds. It is so peaceful here. There is contentment and ease about you. My friends, remember this peace you feel. The ease as it goes through your body. The calmness that is felt. The tension of your daily lives slowly slips away as you seek silence, seek the quietness. The quietness when the thoughts of your illusion have faded. When times are busy, as you make plans and gather friends around, take the time to find the peace in the solitude of being yourself, for when you are at peace with yourself you are able to be at peace with others.

> Hatonn: In this season which you call Christmas there is more than ever a sense of oneness upon your planet. A sense of wishing to share with your brothers and sisters what in a small way you have found, the joy you have felt, helping people open their hearts and their minds to the love of the Creator, of wanting to share this love. My friends, this love is in truth all you are seeking on your paths, whatever path you may choose to walk, you will in the end be at the same place.

> Hatonn: “In Memoriam.” “In the memory of.” How many times have your hearts been touched by the memory of one whose courage, bravery or goodness was so outstanding that your attention is commended and your heart is drawn up in an emotion of love and admiration for the memory of someone, some brave act, some heroic deed. It is written that the one known as Jesus looked past his own physical death and offered to his disciples a proper memorial, for this teacher knew well that those seeds which he had planted during his incarnation, if they were good, would bloom long after that passage which confronted him when he offered bread and wine to his brothers.

## [December 11, 1982, Saturday Meditation](en/1982/1982_1211)


> Hatonn: My friends, you exist within a world of illusion, a school in which there are many lessons to be learned, often requiring the individual entity many lifetimes in which to accomplish this task. This is as it should be, for it is the desire of the Creator that each of His children experience the totality, the fullness of creation. You currently exist within that which [is] described as the third density, and are for the most part occupying the middle ground between two selections of polarization, that of service to self and that of service to others.

Now are the dark and dismal days, the (inaudible), [cloud-filled hours]. Now is the time of each pilgrim resting quietly under the skeleton of a once-leafy tree, (inaudible) the dusty miles behind and pondering the bend in the road ahead and which turn should be taken when two roads converge. Now is the time when the weary pilgrim may learn the lesson (inaudible), for upon its surface is nothing of comfort. It is a creature forged in fire and left to [weather] the millennia.

Indeed, there are times in your lives when that which you know as peace seems even inappropriate for the situation within which one finds oneself. For, as you well know, there are many situations in which your expected behavior patterns do not include a display of peaceful acceptance as an option.

> Hatonn: That which is most central to a confidence about positivity of contact is the proper unification and tuning of the group. This group seeks to know the truth, seeks inspiration, and seeks to serve others. There is in each a spirit of what many would call Christ Consciousness, a desire to know the love and light of the one infinite Creator.

> Hatonn: My friends, we are taking our time with this instrument for she is somewhat fatigued and we are aware that there is a calling for some information and some inspiration which this instrument is capable of channeling given the slow method of communication, for what we have to say is not what this instrument expects. Indeed, we are often a “Johnny-One-Note,” as this instrument would call us, sounding ever the theme of meditation, for only through meditation or a parallel resource of being can you find that original Thought which each of you seeks.

## [October 28, 1982, Intensive Meditation](en/1982/1982_1028)


> Hatonn: As we observe the vibratory complexes of each of you, it occurs to us that perhaps the most helpful form of aiding each instrument in building its own skills at this chosen service at this particular time would be the technique of the telling of a story through all instruments, each telling only a small portion, knowing neither beginning nor end. This is a technique which is reserved for more experienced channels due to the infinite possibilities of panic upon the part of [the] new instrument which does not yet have the confidence to simply speak without analysis of those thoughts which are brought before it.

You do not see the small baby growing moment-by-moment, but over a period of time the growth is very obvious. You have a tendency to become impatient, and you want to see things happen quickly, but if you will think back you will recall experiences and dreams that have fit together and have guided you on the path. So may we say do not be impatient, but be joyful and cheerful as you (inaudible) continue day-by-day as you think of time.

> Hatonn: My friends, it behooves us to bring before your attention at this time the great amount of excess involved in the accepted ways of your peoples. More specifically, the excess of supply, the excess of interpersonal politeness, and the excess of spiritual hypocrisy. How much, my friends, do you need to give you that diaphanous, unshaped and inchoate thing called happiness? What of this world’s belongings are necessary to the establishment and the perfection of your being and your seeking? How soft and how many must be your beds? How redundant your raiment? How filled your rooms within your dwellings and indeed how many rooms do you find necessary within them? Look you to the society with which you have commerce. What do you require of those to whom you have said, “I shall love you”?

> Hatonn: My friends, it is often difficult to experience those passages of time in which one seems to have lost an awareness of the path which one treads. For as those of you [who] have traveled through the forests of your planet are aware, the most pleasurable segments of your travels are those within which events of significance are discerned: a particularly beautiful flower, a joyous song, a passing bird, an impressive outcropping of stones—each of these is an easily discernible landmark of your journey, one which may be easily reexperienced at a later date. But, my friends, was not the greater value of the journey acquired as one quieted oneself in anticipation of that which was to come? Is it not true that the greatest value derived from such a trip is not determined by those seemingly significant objects or experiences, but rather the balance one retains through the journey?

This, my friends, is a very good practice except when carried to the extent that there is no message due to an excess of courtesy.

> Hatonn: If you will start your day with a clean slate and give your friends and your so-called enemies the same privilege, you may inspire yourself and others to change. The past is as dead as the trees in winter. The only difference is the trees will return each spring, but the past is gone. Giving yourself a clean slate helps you to change for the better. Giving your friends a clean slate and also your enemies inspires them not to repeat their mistakes.

Wherever that stranger goes, so do you go. You are with all beings. You are a part of all that there is, yet the opportunities for the learning of the lessons of love are inexhaustible.

As the number of entities increases you may see an increase in those who seek to separate themselves from all other entities. They will try, but ever increasing numbers will act to bring those seeking to separate themselves to look at the self through different eyes.

We stress tonight for each of you the value of acquiring that state of mind and heart wherein you are in the eternal present and your body for the moment makes no demands upon you. The great additions and multiplications and subtractions and divisions of life are gone.

> Hatonn: When an entity such as each of these instruments decides that he or she desires to be of service by receiving concepts and passing them on, these concepts being of a recognized spiritual quality, the decision for this service has an emotional content. In some cases this emotional content is not great, and in these cases, as the novelty wears off, the instrument ceases that particular service and moves on. This is, of course, perfectly acceptable to us and we are grateful for being able to work with any instrument for any length of time.

Therefore, we suggest that if you have tuned and challenged us mentally that you may dispense with the beginning and ending greetings until the end of the message.

You have many brothers and sisters to walk with you, near you on your journey. You need not put excessive burdens upon yourself, for there are those who would, if you would but open yourself to them, help. The journey is so much more pleasant when the burden is shared.

> Hatonn: We would apologize, my friends, through this instrument, for the circumstances that cause us to, at this particular time, request each instrument to continuously tune towards the appropriate amplitudes and harmonies of love and light. It is not, my friends, a usual difficulty that we of the Confederation of Planets experience when we are working with free will groups such as this one, but we say to you that we are experiencing at this time an interference, not of each of you in this group, but rather of the group itself in its identity, as that group which functions as messenger for the Confederation entity known as Ra.

> Hatonn: We look forward this evening to working with each of the new instruments in their endeavor to learn to pick up our channeled messages. It is a great service you perform, each of you perform for us, to give us this opportunity to, in a sense, speak to many more brothers and sisters upon your planet. We are most eager for this opportunity. We are not infallible, of course, but we do have an understanding of some concepts of the Creator which we want to share with you, and you, through your channeling, give us the opportunity to reach others who are seeking who might otherwise not have the benefit of our years of learning similar lessons as we passed through the density of separation.

We are aware as we look into the thoughts of this instrument that this day has meaning to your nation. It is a day called Independence Day, won, my friends, as so many things have been won upon your planet, by killing and forcing one group’s opinion upon another in what seems to be a planetary love of hostile struggle. We know that you as well grieve for those strangers who you have never met, who die violently in unknown lands mouthing the ideals that have been taught them. We know that within your thoughts there lies great concern for those who have killed but have not been killed.

> Hatonn: I was explaining to her that television machines and cooling systems are negative influences. Before television and cooling systems people sat on their front porch and became involved with their other selves. The drama was not as condensed on the front porch but it was real, and they did not feel isolated the way they do in front of their TV set. Even refrigeration is negatively oriented. In the days of the icebox people went down to the drugstore for ice cream. They went to the grocery store because perishables would not keep. They became involved with their other selves.

It is our desire in the future to attempt this often at further sessions so as to familiarize each instrument with our vibration that they might perceive and be confident in our initial contacts.

> Hatonn: Firstly, my friends, we ask you to be aware and fully conscious of the mechanism of faith or belief, by which this contact is made far more accessible. Indeed, the faculty of faith has long since atrophied among many of your peoples, and it is understandable and to be appreciated that this faculty would be used cautiously and in many cases mistrusted. Whereas [when] we look about your peoples, my friends, we find that those who have exercised the faculty of faith have in many cases become overbalanced in the direction of that faith, and so have separated themselves from a great many other entities rather than using that faith to become one with their brothers and sisters.

> Hatonn: As you are well aware, all are one with the Creator, none better, none worse, not separated, not segregated by geography or religion or the ties of nationalities, of race. Each on your planet is in their own unique ways seeking the awareness of the love and light. Few are those who may totally shield their eyes, for the love and light is and surrounds us. Though you may attempt to shield [your] eyes, your being, the awareness and the learning is something that we all will face, and each at his own speed will learn. You need not be disheartened if in your seeking there are times when you seem to stumble or move backward, for the lessons are difficult, but not impossible. Each will learn and in these times that are upon you the lessons will not lessen in any degree.

> Hatonn: We ask each to remember that all of us who call ourselves by the name of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator are but messengers, so that those who speak our thoughts are also messengers. That which comes through us and through you is, therefore, a sometimes simple and sometimes more complex rendering of one basic concept and its implications. The concept is the original Thought, its nature, its unity, and its creative power. Its implications are infinite, and are expressing themselves all about you and to the ends of the endless universe of the Father.

> Hatonn: My friends, there was once a great kingdom beneath the sea. Beneath the green waters and the sand lay golden doors. And some beings there were who under enchantment could enter that majestic world. In this world, my friends, there was no aging. There was no work. There was no ugliness or lack of any kind. All were beautiful. Each meal was a banquet, the only drawback being that the entities of this enchanted land could eat nothing.

> Hatonn: Those few precious moments in which you allow yourself to open may have more effect than all the deliberate thought, all the logical methods of solving problems. So often people believe that everything may be rationalized, everything fits into those qualifications that they establish to fit the concepts of the solution. By doing so, people limit that which they may reach. We would remind that this is an illusion in which you exist, and this illusion does have its limits. It is for you to become aware that the love and the light of the Creator is infinitely more than your illusion. Through your meditations you may begin to pierce the illusion, to feel, to hear, to truly see the light. It is for you to grow, to learn, to experience. It is for you to choose whether you seek to be of service to others or seek to be of service to self. Your task is the same, to become aware of the light, the love.

> Laitos: My friends, in these groups in which we concentrate so much upon service, sometimes we of Laitos may stress too much that great pillar of the life “lived in knowledge of,” and forget to stress with the most abundant emphasis the joy that permeates the universe of this Creator Whom we serve. Too much we stress responsibilities connected with being a pilgrim and not enough do we share with you the reality of freedom that that service brings, for in each attempt to serve the Creator you have freed yourself from the opinion of a disillusioned illusion, you have removed yourself from a dimly lit, habitually angry and negative set of circumstances which persist despite all the beauties of the creation around you, and you have with your eyes in your inner selves glimpsed the reality of an infinite merrymaking, an eternal joyousness, the love that is without end.

You live in a time when the threat of what you call global destruction appears somewhere, someone, who does that one thing that start the dominoes to fall bringing an end to your world. Others live in the fear that the changes that your planet is undergoing, they fear those events occurring in nature will begin to intensify; the earthquakes, severe storms, volcanoes and other natural disasters as you call them, will sweep over your planet and bring great death and destruction.

Your peoples are beginning to feel what many of them say is an urgency of need to quickly learn all, but we ask you to not rush, not grab and try to cram as if you were studying for one of your school tests.

> Laitos: Before we begin to work with you, my friends, we would like to say a few words about this service of being a vocal channel, a messenger of love, a voice for those who serve the Creator with all their strength. First we wish to acquaint you with the concept that a messenger is a servant, one who is humble and who bows the knee before those to whom he speaks. A messenger is not involved in the outcome or the result of the message. The responsibility of the messenger is to the source of that message, that it may be given as truly and as well as the messenger has the capability of doing so.

It might be said that each individual lives within a vacuum, that each isolates himself or herself from the other selves that surround them, and in fear and misunderstanding of the isolation that has been created, each as in a vacuum contracts into himself as if unable to contact the energy with which to expand outward and establish a reunion with those among [whom] one lives.

> Hatonn: You, my friends, with your increased awareness and utilization of choice, often do not realize the shortness of your time. Your lives are a small fraction of even a millisecond, to use your terms, in the universe. So often on your planet the time available in each incarnation is not used. So many wander aimlessly, not feeling the light, engrossed in attempting to gather as much physical comfort as they can, with little regard for that part of themselves that seeks, pushing it aside and falling back. Though the time is short you have ample time if you would but attempt to allow even a small portion of this short time for quiet thought and meditation, to allow your being to become aware of the light of the Creator.

It is seemingly not a significant animal in that its contact with those of your race is very limited. It is generally regarded by many as simply an object of prey for consumption at their tables, yet as with all things of the Creator, it may serve the purpose by its example as being a teacher.

This is not a type of communication where the entity reviewing the incarnation is aware of another individualized being communicating a concept, but rather a type of all-embracing communication of the total of beingness or nature of the creation so that the life experience just passed might be seen in comparison to this wholeness and the further needs for learning might thereby be discerned.

The world echoes the sounds of nature—beautiful, musical peace. My friends, if you would but take a little extra of your time to sit and quietly listen, the world around will speak of many things and you, if you listen, may begin to become more aware of the simple, the profound lessons that the world around you offers.

## [April 15, 1982, Intensive Meditation](en/1982/1982_0415)


> Hatonn: We would like to observe the seeming delicacy of all that surrounds you, the extreme delicacy of the parameters which guard the ability of your physical vehicles to dwell in safety upon this sphere in space, the fragile chain of life which the creation of the Father has provided for all creatures from the smallest to the greatest. Yet we would like to point out that this seeming fragility houses an imponderably huge and immense role of an evolution which goes so far beyond the evolution of the physical form that there are no words to describe this everlasting evolution. It may seem at times that each is a fragile and easily wounded and torn entity, yet there is no possibility of true harm, for there is no ending to consciousness. Physical death cannot touch it, and any experience can only aid it.

> Hatonn: My friends, that which you celebrate at this time of your year is a rebirth and reemergence of life upon your planet and within your souls. It is fitting that the death in the physical form of that one which you call Jesus coincides with this time of rebirth, for just as a change in form occurs throughout those areas of your planet experiencing what you call Spring in that an old form, that of the concealed, that of the waiting, that which seems withered and dead externally but merely conceals and protects the life within, is suddenly abandoned and a new life leaps forth, a life form which was unseen and inconceivable in its previous incarnative form.

> Hatonn: My friends, my loved ones, this is a day traditionally associated on your planet with the remembrance of one known to you as Jesus, Joshua, or known to us as Amira. The mission and accomplishments of this entity while on your planet have been greatly misunderstood by most, in that an effort was made by a number of your people to interpret his words and actions within the framework of that which was earlier understood and yet was so sorely lacking as to require his sojourn upon your planet.

> Hatonn: My friends, there is a cave that is a subterranean maze full of darkness, half-darkness, and into this cave, this cavern, your mind so often travels. There are so many among your peoples who fear these travels that they constitute an enormous majority, and their fear of these deep and secret places of their minds is such that they would do anything which can be done to avoid these places, to not think, to not search, to not be awake. And thus you see around you, my friends, many whose intellects you know to be above adequate who are working quite hard to distract themselves from that great cavern of being which lies below the surface of the comfortable, everyday illusion, and we share with you, my friends, the perception that this search through the mind for truth is risky.

> Hatonn: It is a great blessing that you are able to share your love for one another, your thoughts, your beliefs, your conversation, just as the sharing described in the text which was previously read, the music spoken of in those words, the sharing of love, the awareness of oneness and the acceptance of the blessings which originate from the Creator. Too often those of your race and others find these blessings difficult to accept, for they have strayed far from their original intention and in seeking to reflect the will and the awareness of the Creator by developing themselves as independent yet equal co-Creators, they forget the original intention to return to their source.

> Hatonn: My friends, to speak to you for what to you has been a long period of time has been a great source of joy and of learning for us. We feel privileged that you request us so often to hear the message that we have, the message that is always the same. But always a new facet is shown that you may take each one and study and meditate upon it and add it to the others you have seen and become aware that by summation of the parts you may see that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts can ever be.

> Hatonn: My friends, on your planet the season has changed. New life will soon begin, entities growing, developing, each seeking the light, each wishing its own place in the whole of the Creation. The new life depends on a fragile balance of those things necessary for life in your illusion, the need for water, for food, for light, but each also needs a guide, a hand, whether it is advantage of more suitable genetic traits, such things as plants, or the aid of one more older [as] entities aid the young of your animal life or for the lives of the human.

## [March 12, 1982, Friday Night](en/1982/1982_0312)


> Hatonn: My friends, it is difficult at times to share with one another our feelings of confusion or sorrow, for these emotions stem from an awareness that we are somehow unable to balance within ourselves our perceptions of the universe within which we live. As these emotions, therefore, are based upon confusion it is understandably difficult to attempt to describe to one another these feelings.

> Hatonn: My friends, tonight we would share with you a few thoughts on the subject of purity. It is difficult to conceive of purity within the realm of your illusion, for as your illusion is permeated with indecision, as your illusion is the point at which the individual must select—correction—elect to polarize in one direction or the other, there is a strong tendency to accept a proximity to purity as the totality itself.

> Hatonn: My friends, tonight we would share with you a small story concerning a lamb which had strayed from the flock, from its mother, from the shepherd whose efforts to ensure the lamb’s safety within the flock were circumvented by the lamb’s curiosity. You see, my friends, the lamb, realizing that among the flock there was simply retracing the steps already covered by those around it, chose to wander further and further toward the edge of the flock, seeking experience beyond what could be and often was narrated by its elders.

> Hatonn: The individual known to you as Jesus Christ, known to himself as Amira, came to your race, to your planet, many of your years ago. He sought not to found a religion, a dynasty, or a kingdom on Earth but rather to be of service to those who sought to free themselves from the illusion that had begun to bind them so tightly. It may be said that this man was no greater than any other that has walked your planet, for his accomplishment was, in simple terms, to do that which he intended upon entering your density. My brothers, my sisters, was this not the same purpose for which you yourselves entered this density?

> Laitos: We are happy, as always, to be allowed the chance to help those who seek to serve in the capacity of channels for [the] humble message of the Confederation. Each voice that is lent is greatly appreciated and aids more than can be hoped for. As each receives and speaks the words, the thoughts, each will in their own way express these as their store of (inaudible). Each speaks as his orientation allows. Each channels vocabulary, background knowledge. Each has their own forms of expression, their own ways of conceiving the message that is transmitted to them. Each message may sound a bit different from one channel to another, but the differences in the presentation of the words are not as important as the basic meanings of the whole. While one may be able to use words not in your peoples’ common vocabulary, they say no more than the one whose knowledge of words is small.

> Hatonn: Tonight we wish to speak a few words about compassion, feelings that you experience in regard to your fellow entities, your planet. In your illusion, my friends, you are constantly faced with choices, and each affects, not only you, but also indirectly or sometimes directly affects those around you. These choices, as you develop, may at times seem very clear and shall be easy for you to do that which will aid you the most in your journey, but in your illusion few things are simple. Your illusion is such that in no case can the line clearly be drawn between serving of others, the serving of the self.

New growth will stretch and reach for the light, will bask in the warmth (inaudible) will be nurtured and will fulfill its purpose. My friends, you are reaching, stretching, ever attempting to expose more and more (inaudible) to the light, to the love of the Creator. In this illusion in which you are now a part, you are slowly, steadily, fulfilling your purpose, attempting to be a part of the whole. You, as you become more and more aware of the love that is within, without and that is you, blossoming, growing, fulfilling, as you are nurtured by the light the radiance of yourself shines increasingly brighter. You cannot hide it, for it is part of you and it is there for others to see; whether they can appreciate or not, whether they will become like it or seek to ignore or destroy, the light that is you shines.

We of Laitos know that for many of those who attempt to serve as channels there come times when the individual begins to regress somewhat in the progress they have made. The ones who choose to serve as channels often find doubts in their minds about their abilities, doubts about whether they are truly receiving, doubts about whether they are speaking randomly or not and soon with the message that the Confederation offers.

> Hatonn: We of Hatonn would like at this time to share with you a story, one in which a child is born, lives and dies in the manner of your density, yet accomplishes a great deal more than is obvious to those who shared his presence. The child of whom we speak was in no way outstanding, either physically or mentally. The child was of inauspicious parentage, having been raised of poor parents in a small village. When the child reached maturity he joined himself with a woman for he sought the comfort that this type of companionship could provide. As things progress in your density, the child grew older, fathered children, grew older again, and eventually died.

> Hatonn: It has been said, “To work is to pray,” and for those lucky enough, shall we say, to have found occupations which enable them to supply themselves with the necessities of survival which also feed the spirit, this is in the deepest sense true. You may find these people working with their hands to make beauty, working with their minds as channels of various forms of love, working among people in such a way that their very being is of service in a substantial manner. But for so many, my friends, the connection between the daily life and love, between action and meditation, is not apparent. And in order for you to become able to link in any way the work of empty form which you find yourselves performing and the work which is love, it is recommended that you begin with the meditation rather than with the work.

How diversely you look. Were you capable of travel, your desire is such you would seek the Earth over and you would have many strange experiences, and yet we say to you, you have many and strange experiences.

With change there are two directions that a person can face in order to see change that he or that others around him are going through. One may look in the forward direction or one may look in the direction from which one has already been. Both are equally valuable although it is easy sometimes to be caught in the focusing on one of the two directions.

> Hatonn: My friends, the nature of the journey that you are on is such that it may bring about periods in which you feel that your pilgrimage is no longer functioning properly. We ask you to consider a small example of such a pilgrimage. Take for example the young man. He is alone, and he seeks to make a journey, and as he seeks, he changes. This young man grows older year by year and experiences various locations, various entities. He is a visitor in homes which seem to him to be oh, so normal and so pleasant, and he asks himself over the years, “Why, if I am like other men, can I not have such pleasantness?”
