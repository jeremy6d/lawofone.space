<p>I am Hatonn, and am now with this instrument. We greet you, my friends, in the love and the light of the one infinite Creator. It is indeed a privilege to work with those who seek to improve their abilities to receive and channel the humble messages that we of the Confederation speak to you. We would like to begin, as we have before, [by] beginning a story through one instrument and would then switch our contact to another to continue the story with the first and end it.</p>
<p>My friends, there was once a tree which was situated by the side of a trail at a point where it branched. The tree was not of great stature, and in fact was in its years of decline, becoming softer and starting to hollow and at this time it still stood. The leaves still sprouted and its sap of its life still flowed within. We would now transfer.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(L channeling)</p>
<p>The tree, although it declined, was still capable of bearing fruit and those who passed by, though selecting either path that branched before the tree, would often select a piece of fruit from the tree and bear it with them as they continued their journey down one path or the other and found nourishment and satisfaction from the fruits of this hollow tree. It may be said that the tree in its offerings [of] its fruits was able to travel both journeys while remaining at the branch in the path. We would now transfer.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>The season passed. The tree sent its roots with less and less energy into the life-giving soil and turned its leaves in fewer and fewer numbers to the warmth of the sun and the gentle cleansing and nourishment of the rain, and the path became empty. So rich and so perfect was each piece of fruit, and yet so apparently uneaten, unused, unappreciated. This was of no importance to the tree, for it was in rhythm with its own cycle and it flourished, flowered, bloomed and faded as the seasons rattled the leaves of fall, sifted the snows of winter, warmed the earth of spring, and brightened the skies of summer. We will now transfer this contact.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Jim channeling)</p>
<p>It was felt by many who passed the tree on their journey that there could be no further purpose for the tree, for it seemed that the usefulness had perished with its fruitfulness. There was the feeling of the travelers upon both paths that the tree had fulfilled its purpose and that travelers would now be left without the fruit to take with them upon their journey. But there also were those who saw the season of the tree as providing but one type of fruit, as was understood by those who had been nourished by that fruit. And yet, some said, is there not still a purpose for such a tree, even though its fruit has long since passed? There became an effort to discern what that purpose could be. We will how transfer this contact.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(C channeling)</p>
<p>The purpose of the tree when the fruit was gone became an ever-increasing concern of many who walked past. Instead of looking at other sources or simply ignoring other sources, some of the people began to mourn for the tree, and instead of continuing along their chosen paths, stopped and stayed at that place. Others, however, knew that they could no longer depend upon this single tree for the food to sustain them on their journey [and] decided to seek further along the path for other sources of sustenance. We will now transfer.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>And to those who listened to the tree, the tree seemed to say to them, “My friends, there was a great period when no one passed by. Not to the right, not to the left. But I did not think, because of your absence for a moment of your time, that the path would be forever empty, for I knew that pilgrims, though each may walk alone, forever walk in a great company. No matter that the way be barren and the seekers seemingly absent for awhile, yet still another generation passed by.</p>
<p>“Just so, pilgrims, because I have found the cycle in my being of stillness, does that not mean the chance for another generation of trees to offer you shade and beauty and truth? For did not your fathers eat from me and drop the seeds where they root upon each path?” I would now transfer this contact.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Jim channeling)</p>
<p>“And does not the one Creator who made us all provide for us in seasons of plenty and of scarcity? Does not that one Creator provide the nourishment for life and the means by which the pilgrim of either path might travel through the mystery of the creation? My friends, I lived for much of your time at the fork of these paths and through me did not the Creator show an equal love for all? And now, in this season of my stillness, cannot each pilgrim find the stillness within itself as once was found the nourishment of the outer being? Therefore, my friends, does not the one Creator nourish each entity both within and without, no matter which path is chosen?” We shall now transfer this contact.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(C channeling)</p>
<p>Each is nourished. Each partakes of that which they need: the fruit to nourish, the shade to rest, the branch for a staff to support, the sign that life is renewed. The theme exists, a cyclic harmony that for each creation there is a place along the journey that points the choice, a decision. There are sources such as the tree which offers itself to the traveler in what way it can. Those who partake of the fruit of the tree serve to aid in the scattering of the seed and new sources of sustenance may grow and may in turn be available to the journeyer. We will transfer.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(L channeling)</p>
<p>It is the opportunity of all to serve in a multitude of ways throughout the cycle of their lifespan. At certain points along the curve it may be possible to serve by providing a comfort and the relaxation, the easing of the soul that comes from allowing an other self to rest for awhile within one’s shadow and to support that other self as they lean against you to recover their strength and determination. At another point on the curve, one might be blessed with the opportunity to provide sustenance, and in so doing to sweeten another’s life, no matter their intention or their destination. As the cycle continues, one’s purpose—correction—one’s service might be limited to providing a staff, a source of stability and rigidity that an other self requires to complete their journey, for there are a number who must spend their lives in close contact with an unyielding determination to enable themselves to partake of that determination and so complete their journey and finally, as the circle completes, as the cycle begins anew, one’s service might be to foreshadow the sweetness of the fruits that lie ahead for those who follow either path. We will now transfer.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>My friends, as you experience the continuum of your incarnation, of your cycle, and as you seek to be of service, know that wherever you are, to others you appear to be a stationary object at the branching of two paths. You can never know what service you may provide. One may see your beauty and the sweet blossoms that are lit with the sunshine of springtime. One may find the solace of your shade and take from you that rest which is nourishment to the weary soul. One in hunger may find that gracious and perfect fruit which, unbeknownst to you in your inward life, you have produced and have offered. And one may take a little piece of your being, your words, your thoughts, your actions, and use that image as a staff.</p>
<p>But, my friends, never forget your greatest gift, your greatest service. That is your hollowness, your stillness, your final beingness, for there you stand and there you witness to the great panorama of the creation, our Father. I would transfer at this time.</p>

<p>I would now open this meeting to questions, if any present would desire to query upon any topic of importance. Is there a question?</p>
<p><strong>C:</strong> Hatonn, I’ve noticed there seems to be an increase in frequency with which my son awakens, and his cries withdraw me from my meditation. Is there any information you can offer as to the cause or any suggestions you could make to prevent this occurrence?</p>
<p>I am Hatonn, and can suggest that the young being has a growing desire for your presence due to its own desire to experience that which you can teach it. The young entity is more and more able to perceive that there are opportunities for its own expression to expand which you might be of service in the facilitating of. The meditations which you have found somewhat disturbed by this increased …</p>
