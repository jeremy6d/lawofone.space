> Group question: The question this evening has to do with individual or group efforts to make energy or technological advances available for humanity. The Confederation of Planets had this problem in pre-World War Two when they were giving information to the Manhattan Project scientists who then developed the bomb. Is humanity ready for further technological such as free energy, or if we wish to be of service to … (inaudible).

> Group question: Our question has to do with the harvest and the positive and negative entities who are here with a chance to graduate, so we are seeing a lot of both positive and negative activities and a lot of confusion. Would Q'uo comment on this situation and how we may respond as spiritual seekers, living as though we might die at any moment, living as spiritual warriors, so that each day could be our last day?

> Group question: Our basic message is always the same. It is a simple message, too simple for most to believe or to use. However, it is what we have to offer, and that is that all that there is is love, not (inaudible), words describing romance, not a [pale] word describing friendship, nor any of the ways that the word love has been used, for the love in which we come is the Logos, that one original Thought from which all else has (inaudible).

> Group question: Could you tell us about The Choice, how much we make consciously and how much subconsciously, what we discover as we go through our lives as we consider being of service to others. What about giving over one’s identity in serving another in what are called co-dependent relationships? How does that differ from true service? What really are we doing when we make any choice?

> Group question: The question this evening has to do with a phrase from the Ra contact which said that the price of each action of a positively oriented nature was in direct proportion to the purity of the action; and we would like some information upon this price that we seem to pay with each desire we have to be of service. And the situation that it puts us within presents us with challenges, difficulties, confusions and so forth, and these seem to be part of this price. We would like to have any information that you could give us as to the price that we pay, how we pay the price and what it is that we’ve bought with this price.

> Group question: Concerning seeking and searching. We often have things happening inside of us that are quite intense and we don’t know how to work with them. How can we work with these situations? Grab hold of them and try to understand them or let them go and develop on their own?

> Group question: We are asking about service today. First, we seem to need a sense of self in order to know what it is we have as resource to serve with, and secondly, we would ask if it is even appropriate to concentrate on serving others in our daily round of activities, or is it more a part of our beingness to serve in a less directed effort? What is the true nature of teaching when it comes to serving others?

> Group question: The question for this afternoon has to do with discipline in the sense of the disciplines of the personality that Ra spoke of in the Law of One information. We would like Q’uo to give us a little better idea as to what this discipline of the personality amounts to and how it is arrived at and the attitude one has when one exercises it as opposed to, say, our normal idea of discipline which is an idea of doing something rather out of the sense of duty or being ordered to do so or because you think it’s right, then it doesn’t have a very pleasant connotation about it, and we would like to have Q’uo talk to us about disciplines of the personality.
