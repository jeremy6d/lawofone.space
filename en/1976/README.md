> Hatonn: We’re concerned. We are helpless, you might say, in some respects for we can only give information in certain limited ways. We give information through channels such as this one simply because the channel is receptive and has allowed the information to pass through him. Had he not allowed this, we could not give this information. There would be no way available (inaudible), for this is the desire of our (inaudible). 
That, and only that which is desired will be given. Only that which is desired will be received. For this reason, those upon your planet will be receiving, as always, precisely what they desire.

> Hatonn: It is very important to your peoples at this time that you seek the knowledge of who you are and what you truly want for your planet, and indeed your whole solar system is at this time progressing into a new area of space and a new vibration of experience. This has been said by so many of your own people we do but echo this truth. It has even been given a name. Many of your people speak of the Aquarian Age, or the Golden Age. You may join the Age that is to come, that is already becoming apparent, if your vibrations are such that they are in harmony with that vibration. That is what we are here to tell you. That is our purpose here: to share with you our understanding. Our understanding is that we are all created as one being. That that one being is in a state of perfect love and harmony. And that our purpose in this and every experience is to more fully realize and understand the reality of that perfect love.

> Oxal: I am Oxal. My greetings to you. Many of you have never, shall we say, heard my voice. It is rare that I am given the opportunity to speak with you. Yet I am present at all of your meetings working with those of you who are desirous of obtaining those goals in life which you may or may not be aware of. And it is that upon which I desire to speak this evening.

> Hatonn: Generally, we address these groups and share with them philosophical viewpoints. And within these viewpoints there can be found in-depth meanings and clues to assist you as you journey through this life experience. And among these clues, shall we say, the most two important which we can stress is the practice of meditation and the practice of service unto your fellow man, which is in itself is the expression of love.

> Hatonn: My friends, there are laws which are not written in the books of men. There are laws that override all of the, shall we say, cardinal laws of your planet. There are laws which are handed down to the people upon your planet through what you would call teachers. One of these teachers was that person whom you refer to as the Christ. One of the laws, shall we say, that he commanded to his disciples was, “To know thyself.” My friends, if you wish to journey throughout this life and gain from it the greatest benefit, then you must first, above all things, know thyself.

> Hatonn: We of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator have come to your planet to share with your peoples a message. It is a very simple message. And it is much required by your peoples at this time. We come in answer to a call that has gone out from your peoples, for so many of you upon your surface are seeking at this time: are seeking to know the reason for your existence; seeking to know why you were created and who your Creator is. This call is as audible to us across what you would call vast distances as if we were right beside you. And we are here to attempt to serve those who are seeking at this time by sharing our impressions concerning the question of why each of us is here.

Our service at this time is limited, but shortly the limitations under which we now serve you will be lessened.

> Hatonn: My friends, your thinking is all that exists. The entire universe is thought. All that is necessary for any condition or any experience is thought. We extend to you simple instructions to be used in an extremely beneficial environment to create a very rapidly accelerated evolution of thought. Make use of your present condition, for it has been chosen, it has been desired, in fact, as you say, totally programmed by yourself. It is for your benefit, my friends, each of you individually. Make use of your present condition, for this is what you planned to do. Do it, to reach that goal that each of us so earnestly desires: the goal of union in thinking with our Creator. For in this union, my friends, is all that you could ever possibly express in love.

> Hatonn: This evening we would speak to you upon the subject of what you would call tribulations. As you are aware, those upon planet Earth are undergoing, shall we say, an experience of growth and one of learning. Your life in its entirety is an accumulation of lessons, lessons which you have designed to experience, lessons through which you can learn the truths and the application of those truths that will enable you to bring about the existence that you truly desire. And that existence, my friends, may be expressed in many words, but shall we say, [any] orthodox expression would be the existence within heaven.

> Hatonn: We of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator are here with you at this time to share with the people of your planet a very simple thought, a very simple concept. That concept is love. We have been here before, and we are here now, to share this concept with you.

> Hatonn: You, as brothers and sisters on the planet Earth, have an obligation to one another, and that is to love one another. And you may ask, “How is it that I am able to learn to love those who would not return that love?” It is, my friends, to be known that love is something that is contained within you, in infinite abundance, and it is replenished and multiplied by sharing with others that love that is within you. Love is not of a selfish nature. Love possesses nothing. Love asks nothing in return. Love is a state of, shall we say, consciousness which is pure and unaffected by its surroundings. Once you truly understand this, then you can truly begin to know the concept of love.

> Hatonn: Our message to you has always been simple, and yet because, my friends, your spirits are encased in flesh, our message is never understood in a simple manner, for it filters into your ears in such a way that the simplicity is lost. We tell you that all things are love, that you are love, and that your entire existence is a process whereby your whole purpose is to become aware of your true nature; that is, to become aware of the oneness of all things and of the nature of that one thing as love. It is a simple message.

> Hatonn: We offer you our love. What we offer you, my friends, O men of Earth, what we offer you is more precious than any treasure you can imagine. And yet we mourn that so few know of the treasure of love. O men of Earth, we speak to you now in sorrow, that so many of your peoples value only those things which cost what you would call money. O men of Earth, you spend your time seeking after so many things that do not advance you on your spiritual path. How long will you sleep?

> Hatonn: We say to you that it is you, my friends, each one of you on an individual basis has within you the ability to achieve all that you would desire. You have within you the ability to create that which you desire to experience. You are an extension of that which we call the Creator. You are His thought patterns projected throughout the infinite universe. You cannot be separated from Him, nor can you be separated from one another. Yet, you have been given the opportunity to express that creating force through your personality and individuality upon this physical plane of existence, in order that you might come to the realization that, indeed, all things are divine and unified.

> Hatonn: As I was saying, my friends, to attain mastery on the physical planet a great deal—sometimes it may seem an infinite amount—of knowledge must be gained. It is, of course, an aspect of your physical illusion that it does seem as though a certain quantity of intellectual information will constitute the knowledge that you do need to attain understanding.

> Hatonn: Man must learn all that he can in the time that he has, for this is his purpose for being here at this time. The purpose for the existence of all things is the unfoldment of consciousness, or to simply state, it is for the experience of love. My friends, as you are well aware, throughout your life love is a continually growing and learning process. If you allow yourself to become stagnant in that which you have discovered, you shall find yourself becoming, shall we say, eventually ill at ease with your position. So allow yourself to be continually seeking greater and greater portions of the immeasurable love which is available to you. Seek this through all of your actions, through all your thoughts. Allow this to be your goal.

> Hatonn: We of the Confederation consider man, upon the planet Earth, to be of great importance. We consider him to be our brother. For throughout our experiences and what you might call our travels, we have come to realize that there is a greater unification between all things within this universe or creation than one can realize through the processes of the intellect. Many of the philosophies which are shared among your people speak of the concept of oneness, oneness of creation. And, indeed, we have found that this concept expresses most easily the truth of the existence of our creation.

This knowledge is continually attained within you and is constantly available for your usage.

> Hatonn: My friends, I would speak with you tonight on the subject of progression. For, my friends, since you have started on the path, so far away now, you have sought after that knowledge which is accompanied by progression. My friends, in fact you have done well. As you know, you were all brought together in order to teach, and learn from, each other of the knowledge of love.

> Hatonn: There is a tree outside your dwelling, my friends. And on this tree are many, many leaves. And some of these leaves are almost perfect. Their shape is completely symmetrical and their color is beautifully green, as it should be. And there is no mark or damage and all within this particular leaf is perfect. And on the same tree, other leaves have been damaged by insects, or they have grown in a crooked manner, or their coloration is not as it is expected to be. And yet these are not good leaves and bad leaves. For within them, each, is the same perfect leaf, which is not separate from the leaf, as an ideal, but is within that leaf and is the true reality of that leaf.

> Hatonn: And so we say to you: in time, with patience, the questions that are troubling you will become very clear. Questions and problems are a result of the illusion in which you are now experiencing your existence, so that what is actually a unity seems to be a process and things seem to take time. In actuality, my friends, from your birth to your death and long before your birth and long after your death, to infinity, all is one time, and one creation.

> Hatonn: We would like to begin by speaking with you about meditation. It is a technique that can be approached in endless ways. Tonight, we would like to say a few words about your physical body and its relation to meditation. Become aware, my friends, at this time of your symmetry as you sit comfortably in meditation. Your two legs, balanced. Each arm resting comfortably. Your eyes, my friends—the space between them, just balanced. That which you hear is being received symmetrically, stereophonically, by your ears. And you are in balance, each side in balance. You are a creature, in the body, of this duality—your right and your left. It is a symbol for all to see of the nature of the physical universe: that there are always two sides, two qualities, to be reconciled in balance.

[Read transcript](en/1976/1976_0516)

> Hatonn: I would speak to you this evening of several things. First, one thing: you may have wondered, because of the recent increased activities of our craft within your skies, why our messages to you have become more, shall we say, involved not with politics and reasoning about our appearances in your skies, but on the contrary, our messages to you who have meditated together with us, have become more and more on the strictly philosophical or spiritual level. Our appearances are part of the plan which you are all aware of, to alert those upon your planet who are sleeping, in such a way that they will begin to search for a way to wake up.

> Hatonn: There has been a request within the group for information about reported psychic predictions. Although we do not normally deal in specific information, we will attempt at this time to speak on a somewhat more specific level, due to the request, for we feel that the request was made in a spiritual manner and not in a manner of trying to find proof. Therefore, we will go to the limit of our ability to speak without infringing upon free will.

> Hatonn: We were saying: many of those who have come into the world by incarnation have experienced in other incarnations a structure in society, as you call it, which was substantially enough different from the structure of society as it is today that there are remarkable and far-reaching conflicts. This is absolutely understandable and reasonable but only so when you understand that the problem between individuals and their so-called society is that the individuals involved do not have experience with this type of structure but with other structures, which are, may we say, perhaps more conducive to spiritual growth than this particular type of structure.

> Hatonn: You see, my friends, as you go through your daily lives, and as you are seeking the correct path for yourself, as you bend your attention to your perceptions of beauty and of ugliness, it is sometimes very helpful to remember that although you are within a physical illusion at this time, and although you are within many higher and finer illusions beyond that, yet also within you ultimately there is only one reality, and if you can observe from the point of view of this reality, your perceptions will be greatly enhanced within the illusion.

It is our fervent belief that the intellectual information which we share with you is of great benefit along your path. Each person must choose the path that he would wish to follow. And each person, in choosing that path, must realize that the path he has chosen shall lead to the ultimate point of interception with all other paths, the point of oneness.

> Hatonn: Throughout many experiences each individual forms for his or herself opinions judging from the experiences. As you pass on throughout your journeys, you shall form many of these opinions. These opinions may better be expressed as concepts. Your experiences shall be infinite in number, and your concepts shall also be infinite. Yet all of the experiences and all of the concepts which you have formed can be described as being within the concept of love.

> (Source not named): Before we begin to answer your questions, we would like to respond to a mentally asked question. It is something that this instrument does not particularly like to do, but we feel it is good for both the instrument and the questioner to occasionally experience this form of channeling.

> Hatonn: The infinite, universal creation has infinite densities, infinite progressions. And in each progression there is a brotherhood of those upon the same path, those striving towards the same understanding. And as one reaches one higher rung, one of the privileges of learning is responsibility for those below. For we can no longer ascend higher unless we are endeavoring to the utmost to bring those just below us with us.

> Hatonn: I am He who is among you. I am He who is within you. I AM. My brothers, dwell now within the I AM that you are. For I AM, not only now but always. Before this world was created and when it is long since passed again into infinite space, I AM. The creation began with consciousness, the consciousness of one vibration, each and every particle totally unified, totally homogeneous, of only one identity, that identity being love.

> Hatonn: My friends, to answer a question which has been on the minds of some of you, and to further your own understanding of meditation itself, we want to quickly discuss with you what happens during your channeling, as you call it. You see, not all channeling is the same.

> Hatonn: We claim to be members of a confederation of planets yet we feel that there can be no justification of this claim, for, my friends, a confederation means a drawing together of units to form a body, and in truth, my friends, there are no units. There is only the existence of one thing, and this one thing that exists cannot be separated.

> Hatonn: I have little to add through this instrument on the subject of suffering. The very word in your language indicates how real the illusion is to you. And indeed, this is as it should be. If the illusion were not “real,” you would not learn from it. It would not be an effective catalyst and you would not progress sufficiently under its stimulus.

> Hatonn: Is it not so, my friends, that both illusion and reality, to the extent of our understanding, are made up of cycles, so that what you call the cycle of your world is rooted in meaning. The cycle of numbers is echoed in the natural cycle of the creation of the Father. And the ingredients of this cycle are what you call love and light.
