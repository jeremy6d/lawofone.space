## [November 15, 1974, Friday Meditation](en/1974/1974_1115)


> Hatonn: I would simply like not to let the opportunity pass to remind you, my friends, of the unity of all things. Meditate, my friends, upon the complete unity of yourself and all that you see. Do this not once, and not simply in present circumstances, but at all times and especially in difficult circumstances. For, my friends, insofar as you love and feel at one with those things which are difficult for you, to that extent will those circumstances be alleviated. This is not due to any laws within our physical illusion, but is due to the law of love. For that body which is of spirit, which is interpenetrated with the physical body, is higher than your physical body. And those changes which you make by love upon your spiritual body, will, of necessity, reflect themselves within the physical illusion.

## [October 13, 1974, Sunday Meditation](en/1974/1974_1013)


> Hatonn: There are millions surrounding your planet, surrounding it with one purpose in mind: to bring to you understanding. Friends, this is something that we can only offer. It is necessary for man on Earth to reach out and take it, for understanding must always come from within. We cannot bring it to you and force it into you as a food. We can only stimulate your seeking through suggestion, through teachings such as we are performing now so that you through your own understanding can once more find the light that is within all men throughout all this creation.

## [October 4, 1974, Friday Meditation](en/1974/1974_1004)


> Hatonn: We, the Confederation of Planets in the Service of our Infinite Creator, are here, as we have stated many times, to aid those of the people of Earth who would seek our aid. I am aware that many of the peoples of this planet are not inclined to seek our aid. Many of the peoples of this planet are not inclined to seek anything beyond the illusion that now fascinates them. Many of these peoples believe that they are experiencing the most real portion of their existence. They also believe that there is nothing to seek of any value beyond their present illusion. This is quite erroneous. They do not realize that they are presently experiencing the illusion in which they find themselves because of their desire to limit to this form their experience. They do not realize that they are experiencing an insignificantly small portion of that which they might experience.

## [September 22, 1974, Sunday Meditation](en/1974/1974_0922)


> Hatonn: When we say that we know those whom we wish to help and those whom we do not wish to help, we do not speak of knowledge in your sense, and therefore that which we say to you concerning your progress as channels is prone to misunderstanding and even error. And yet the fact remains that there is a [flock]. And those of you who have the calling must be shepherd to them. And it is true that there are those who wish to be of the flock, and that there are those who do not wish to be of the flock. And we say to each of you who is a channel, your inner eye is unclouded. It is only your outer eye which becomes confused and which sees mists and quicksand. Therefore, in your work which is a good service, use your inner eye, for that alone will serve you as you do the will of the Father.

> Hatonn: We are aware that within your thinking there are many shades of differences and that you are fascinated with the idea of the various steps you must take in order to proceed on the path. We are aware that you have a desire to understand the various categories of experience, the various densities, that you have a desire for naming that which you will begin to understand.

## [July 30, 1974, Tuesday Meditation](en/1974/1974_0730)


> Hatonn: There is, my friends, only one thing worth seeking. Nothing else is of any value. And that one thing, of course, is understanding; an understanding of your Creator’s Thought. My friends, this is the only thing that lasts. Anything else that you might seek will be transitory and will vanish with time. When man realizes that this is his true objective, then he has made that great turning point in his development. We are here to aid those who have turned the corner, so to speak, turned the corner toward their ultimate goal, that goal of reuniting with their Creator.

> Hatonn: … and gives both great beauty and sweet smell, so as you open to that primary Thought which created you, you blossom within. I come, shall we say, with a watering can. I come to encourage your growth in the spirit, my friends. I urge you through your meditation neither to add nor to subtract. It is very easy to make demands of yourself and to attempt to accomplish goals through meditation. It is also an extremely likely happening that you will at some time attempt to remove some part of that which you are through your meditation.

> Hatonn: My friends, in truth, the only reason for the illusion that you now experience is to act as a catalyst, to act in such a way as to generate a condition which helps the individual to initiate a spiritual seeking.

> Hatonn: We of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator are always with you. This seems strange to you that we would be at all times with you. But this, my friends, is the case. Your awareness of the illusion is such that you do not understand the real properties of that principle that you understand as time. You are that principle that you understand as space. My friends, it is possible for you to be in one place or all places at the same instance. For, my friends, in truth there is only one instance and that instance is the one that you are experiencing. There is an illusion of past and an illusion of future. However, my friends, you exist only in the present.

## [July 3, 1974, Wednesday Meditation](en/1974/1974_0703)


> Hatonn: I would like to tell you a little story about a person who was much like each of you. His thoughts were as your thoughts, and in his, as you would say, work-a-day world he was neither perfectly good nor perfectly evil, but somewhere in the middle, attempting to do the best that he could. This man carried about his ankle a ball and chain, as you call it, a heavy weight attached with an unbreakable lock. And everywhere he went, he had to take infinite pains to make each step.

> Hatonn: That which you are speaking of is not the phenomena which you are waiting for. There is another one of a more local nature. There was a sign available for you on the night in mention which some of you saw. The general and gradual effect within the night sky will be accomplished over a period of time. And you will have no doubt of its progress because those of your technology, which you call scientists, will speak, offering explanations of the subject as its progress occurs more and more within the night sky.

> Hatonn: We are here, my friends, to assist you in any way possible. It is only necessary, my friends, for you to avail yourself. The best method, of course, to avail yourself to our help, to our thoughts is through meditation. Meditation opens the doorway—the doorway that leads to truth. The truth you seek will be realized by all of you in time (inaudible). Some members of your group are active in their seeking. Others not so active. But all, my friends, are seeking (inaudible) and will eventually arrive at the same realizations.

> Hatonn: And what do we have to give you, my friends? We have to give you most of all a door. Only a doorway. Only a suggestion. We have to give you the suggestion of another world. Another complete reality. A reality that transcends this reality, that includes this reality, that explains this reality, that will completely outlast this reality and to which reality you will repair after this brief experience upon the earth plane.

> Hatonn: As you continue upon your path of seeking, my friends, you will find that even in group meditation there will be profound silence, for with those who have obtained direct contact with us there are many concepts which may best be presented within the silence.

> Hatonn: We are aware that you have questions at this time. We are aware that you wish to know if we are, as you say, robots. No, my friends, we who are speaking to you are individualized portions of consciousness in the same mode of being as are you. The robots or computers that you became acquainted with in your reading about Uri Geller are not of the same type as what you know as robots or computers. It is more simple than it sounds, my friends. The Confederation is a unity of thought and of mind, my friends. There are many (inaudible) and types of entities who dwell within this creation who wish to be of service to others and who have joined as brothers in this Confederation to serve the Creator, each in his own way.

> Hatonn: Within the illusion, my friends, there are many obstacles. The illusion, in fact, is designed to produce the obstacles which will deliver unto you the choices which you desire for learning how to be of greater service to others. The lessons of this density, my friends, are lessons of service to others. And each obstacle is an opportunity which is a (inaudible) within the illusion think it is difficulty. Each obstacle is your opportunity to grow. (Inaudible).

## [June 11, 1974, Thursday Meditation](en/1974/1974_0611)


> Hatonn: There are more people upon this planet seeking than there have been in the past. However, many are quite confused in their attempts to seek and there is a need at this time for many more channels such as this one who can receive directly the thoughts that so many of the people of this planet are now seeking. We are attempting at this time to generate greater numbers of proficient vocal channels who can receive our thoughts quite readily. This requires daily meditation. This is all that is required: daily meditation. It is assumed, of course, that as this daily meditation is performed there is a desire for our contact.

## [June 9, 1974, Sunday Meditation](en/1974/1974_0609)


> Hatonn: We wish to assure that the service of channeling will be one which is very valuable in your immediate days to come. It is not (inaudible) that you will be asked specific questions by many who seek, although this will certainly be true. It is also that this contact will give you confidence and with this confidence you may the more carefully carry on your own program of seeking in such a way that you will recognize that which is there for you to do, for you to know, and for you to be aware. Much of the attempt which is initially made by those who begin seeking to discover their inner selves is such a confused attempt that it must be simply guided into another attempt. Therefore, many questions which you will receive will have very little meaning to you in light of your contact with the knowledge and understanding of the One Who is All.

## [June 8, 1974, Saturday Meditation](en/1974/1974_0608)


> Hatonn: Man upon Earth is conscious and intelligent and yet for the most part he is unaware of reality. He is unaware of the simple reality that he is capable of sensing with his physical senses. In addition, he is unaware of the much greater reality that lies outside the boundaries of his physical senses. For the most part, man on Earth has neglected the beauty and the order of the creation that surrounds him. He neglects notice of his total support by this creation. He neglects noticing that he breathes the atmosphere without which his physical body could not exist. He neglects perceiving that he partakes of the food that is amply supplied by the Creator.

> Hatonn: My friends, this evening I would like to say a few words about the concept of death. Why do I bring this up, my friends? It seems the proper time to ask you to hold it as clearly as you can as a concept of a real and specific context within your imagination. Imagine your own death, my friends. Imagine each death and dismal corridor of pain and difficulty and lack of faith (inaudible). Imagine all the evil, the negativity, the limitations. Imagine it all, my friends. Allow it to build and build and build until you have a big and towering mountain of death and destruction.

I have been here for some time and I have been observing classes of students that my brother Hatonn is working with. I have found communication with your people interesting and delightful. I have not spoken through an Earth instrument until a few months ago when I spoke through this instrument for the first time. I told him, at this time, I was not of this galaxy. I am from another galaxy entirely different from this planet’s.

No one can know better than some of you here tonight that our mission on planet Earth has not been as successful as we had hoped. The harvest is coming, my friends, it is coming very quickly. And the harvest will be somewhat smaller than we had ever hoped. And in this fact we experienced a degree of sadness for we attempted to the best of our ability to alert all of those on the planet known as Earth who could hear to the possibility of a higher existence. And in many, many cases this information was not recognized or desired. You, too, from attempting to express the thoughts of the Creator have often found this to be so. And I am aware of the great sadness that you too feel.

> Hatonn: The man of which you spoke is a somewhat rare type of entity. He is among those who have chosen to incarnate upon the surface in order to be of some aid to those upon the surface of this planet. Much of what he is able to do is dependent upon those areas of awareness which he has brought into this incarnation upon this planet. It would not be possible for this person to be used as a type of channel were he not what you might call a somewhat advanced being. He is telling the truth about each of his experiences and there are those within the Confederation who have given to him certain access to certain thoughts, which lead him to be able to exercise his natural gifts in such a way that he is able to aid your people.

You are all seeking the truth, my friends. You are all seeking understanding. You are all seeking reality.

This, my friends, might seem to some of your peoples to be an infringement. But I can assure you that it is not. Our capabilities of knowing the thinking of the peoples of the planet Earth are not designed in any may to infringe upon either their thinking or their activities. We do not consider the knowledge of the thoughts of others to be an infringement for we see these thoughts as our own. We see these thoughts as the thoughts of the Creator.

> Hatonn: Desire, my friends, is the key to what you receive. If you desire it, you shall receive it. This was the Creator’s plan, a plan in which all of His parts would receive exactly what they desire. My friends, often in the illusion which you now experience it seems that you do not acquire what you desire. In fact, exactly the opposite seems to be the case in many, many instances. It is a paradox, it seems, that such a statement should be made and that such apparent results of desire are manifested. And yet, we state without exception, that man receives exactly what he desires.

> Hatonn: I am aware of your question. The fear of, as you say, being possessed is a somewhat over-generalized fear. We may assure you that you have nothing to fear if you are under a certain amount of correct understanding as to the nature of what you know as possession.

> Hatonn: My friends, as we experience this present awareness of shared fellowship with you our hearts are very light. We are, as you would say, very happy to be speaking with you. My friends, we are always very happy. We suggest that you look around yourselves and inquire of yourself as to what portion of your creation seems to be always at peace or happy. You will find, my friends, that it is the creation of the Father that remains in equilibrium while the creation of man of Earth has many unhappy phases.

Have you allowed yourself to soak up the infinite light and love of your Creator during this day? Or, my friends, has it been a day during which you felt some lack of this love in which you felt that you were separated from the sunlight and the warmth of life?

> Hatonn: My friends, we would like to say a few words about the nature of the physical illusion. At the time at which each of you incarnated, my friends, each of you was aware that certain lessons, hitherto unlearned, were to be the goals for achievement of this incarnation. If it seems to you, my friends, that your entire incarnation within this illusion has been a series of difficulties of one particular type, then you are almost certainly aware in some manner of one of your lessons. As you can see, these lessons are not to be avoided. They are to be learned.

> Hatonn: I am aware that there is a question about what you call a UFO sighting. We are not aware of more than one sighting. We find in the mind of this instrument that a sighting has been had by one of you, with which we did not have a part. We do not know without consulting records what it was that you saw. However, we assume that you would be interested in knowing of the one which we are aware. The patterns which were drawn in the sky were drawn by a member of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of Our infinite Creator. We indulged ourselves at that particular time and for the general purpose of sending a reason (inaudible). It is very seldom that this situation is possible. A specific type of attitude must have been nurtured over a fairly long period of time in most cases. However, the attitude of accepted (inaudible) was present, and so we sent a reason (inaudible).

> Hatonn: It is always a very great privilege to speak to those who seek. Seeking, my friends, takes place in many and varied ways. What is important is the seeking, not its definition or its appearance. When an individual begins to seek, he will find. What he will find will seem to be different with respect to others who also seek, in many instances. However, it will only apparently be different, for they will be finding the same thing. For, my friends, there is in truth only one thing to find and that is the love and the understanding of our Creator.

And as we patiently search among the people of your planet, we find very few whose actions we would call normal. It is as though the people of planet Earth are all mysteriously prey to some widespread emotional disorder.

How much of your thinking is involved with striving, attaining and grasping at things within the physical illusion? What fire consumes you? What greed or envy or base desire have you allowed to continue to have power over your thinking? And then, my friends, what portion of your thinking is clear, calm, motionless, humble, unassuming, and content?

This varies somehow—this instrument has made an error—this varies somewhat depending upon the conditions that are surrounding him. At this time the conditions are quite good and he is receiving my thoughts almost in a word for word fashion, since I am familiar with your language and am also able to transmit the words that I wish for the instrument to speak.

And for this reason we will speak this evening on the subject of seeking.

> Hatonn: There are many ways to meditate. There is, however, only one true form of meditation. It is necessary, if meditation is to be effective, that the intellectual mind be allowed to cease functioning, for this acts as a type of interference to realizing and understanding that is within all beings. In order to do this it is necessary to learn how. There are many, many techniques employed in this practice. It is extremely simple for those who have mastered it and seemingly very difficult for those who are still attempting to master it.

> Hatonn: If you consider the source of your thoughts producing the messages that are said to be from the Confederation is within yourself, then you are correct. However, you are also correct if you consider the source of these messages to be Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator. There is confusion among those of the people of your planet who act as channels for that which we bring to the people of your planet. We are real, as real as yourselves. Our methods of communicating with the people of your planet are varied. In some instances, there are thoughts that are given to you from us. However, these thoughts are then your thoughts for they were given to you to keep. And they were given to you by yourself, for we are you and you are we. There is only one consciousness. There is no separation.

> Hatonn: My friends, we have come to a place in dealing with the information which we give to your group where we are aware that there are a certain intensification of difficulties. There is a reason for this time of difficulty. You must have thought to yourself lately that a slight intensification of difficulty seems to be occurring among those who are seeking within the group. The reason for this, my friends, is very simple. The whole mission that we of the Confederation of Planets in Service to the Infinite Creator have here is simply the alerting of those of you upon the planet’s surface who wish this alerting of the knowledge of the true pathway of spiritual seeking. Once you have been alerted, my friends, to the fact that your physical existence is the environment that you have chosen in order to learn, you will after that begin to experience a certain cycle of testing. As you learn more about the spiritual path you will find a way to either demonstrate that knowledge or to refrain from demonstrating that knowledge.

> Hatonn: My friends, we would like to speak with you this evening on the subject of the physical illusion. This illusion is very difficult to comprehend from within the illusion for like a dream it often defies identification from within itself. However, when one wakes up from a dream, one is aware that one has dreamed. And when this segment of your infinite and eternal journey has been completed you will be aware of that which is known as life. You will be aware that this life is an illusion, the illusion of the physical.

Service, my friends, is a concept which is very difficult to express to the people of your planet for it is a spiritual concept of such a nature that it baffles the intellect. However, we will attempt to speak of it in such a way that you may more readily understand what service is.

> Hatonn: I am aware of certain questions that I will attempt to answer at this time. I am at this time going to speak of a phenomenon known to you as channeling. Channeling, my friends, is something that is available to all but not sought by all. It is necessary that an individual truly desire to become a vocal channel in order to do so. This, my friends, is the most important of all of the factors involved in channeling: that the individual who is to be a channel desire to be one. This desire also governs the ability of a channel to channel different types of messages and different contacts.

> Hatonn: We would like to say a few words to you about this seeking, my friends, and this is, as we have said many times before, our only concern is to help you with your spiritual seeking. A great deal of activity has already taken place upon the surface of your planet and within its atmosphere by way of interaction between those of us in the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator and those who dwell upon the surface of your planet. Each confrontation of whatever nature was intended in some respect or another to turn those people involved toward an attitude of seeking. In many cases, my friends, we would say the majority of cases, this attempt worked, in that whatever anomalistic phenomenon—as this instrument would put it—occurred created the alerting mechanism in that entity’s mind which it was intended to create.

> Hatonn: We would like to give you this one thought this evening and that is that our only aid to you is to give you a concept of understanding. What you are seeking is understanding. The fire and the energy with which you seek it is drawn from within the very marrow of your eternal reality. Your true desire is to seek this understanding. This understanding, in turn, my friends, that we are attempting to aid you in becoming aware of is very, very simple. It is, in fact, unitary. There is only one. This unity within which the entire Creation resides is whole, complete, unbreakable and transcendent of all illusion. There, my friends, it is the most impossible thing to conceive of within the boundaries of your intellect and your consciousness with the physical.

Our only desire is to aid those of the flock who seek our aid. The aid you seek, my friends, has become very much focused upon true seeking than that of most of the sheep of the flock. Therefore, what can we say to you intellectually is more and more lacking in complete satisfaction. It is for this reason, my friends, that we stress to you, even as you are gaining advancement, the continued need for more and more meditation. For, my friends, what we can give you through use of the intellect and language is a very small percentage only of what we are able to give you by direct contact—mind to mind.

> Hatonn: I am Hatonn. I was saying that in the future every member of this group who desires to serve those who seek this service will have the opportunity to serve. If this service is to be effective, it will be necessary to one offering service to fully qualify [to do so.] These qualifications may be obtained in only one way. It is necessary to spend time each day in meditation. There is no other way that the qualifications that will be necessary to serve your fellow man can be obtained. We speak of true service. We speak about service that will bring to those of the peoples of Earth who desire understanding the understanding which they desire. This is all that we are attempting to do, for this is all that is necessary. For once this understanding is [acquired] by an individual, he then needs nothing else. For he is, then, an integral part of the Creation in every respect. He, then, no longer is separated in an illusory way by the illusion which he and his fellow man have created for their experience. And this, my friends, is the only thing man on Earth needs, the understanding that allows him to dissolve the illusion in which he now finds himself.

Therefore, we have more to say than we can ever say and we have very, very little to say, for our truth is very simple and all we really wish to do is to propagate that truth as we understand it to you to the best of our ability to as many people as possible in the time allotted to us.

The little island detects many strange things as they enter its purvey. It lives through differences in climate and feeling and mood. It experiences the seasons of its flora and its fauna and it attempts to piece together a reasonable and holistic view of its reality.

> [Hatonn]: It is very often that these words are misunderstood for one reason or another. The difficulty, my friends, is the constant use of the intellect taught to all people who have been at all educated. There is very little spiritual training that would be most helpful in supplying a spiritual development in a growing entity. As the physical body grows, the entity within is educated upon those portions of your planet which are now receiving the aid of technological advances. This enables his intellect to grow and his body to grow. There is much lacking after these two items have become mastered

> Hatonn: What is it that you seek? My friends, you seek understanding. And what is understanding? Understanding, my friends, is not precisely what you think it is. Understanding is not an intellectual interpretation of the creation or of its realities. It is not an emotional response to reality in what I might call the most approved fashion. Understanding is not an emotional or intellectual response to your fellow creatures. Understanding, my friends, is very, very simply understanding the demonstration of the love of your Creator.

> Hatonn: Desire is a somewhat misunderstood phenomenon upon planet Earth, the misunderstanding lying principally in the feeling that one has desires about only certain sorts of objects. My friends, the term “desire” is very pale for what we are aware of as desire. The truth, my friends, is much closer to the intensity of fire. There is, however, no such word as what we are looking for and we use the word desire.

> Hatonn: The conditioning wave, my friends, is sent in a blanket wave. Some physical vehicles are attuned to accept the conditioning wave in a certain way so that it shows up immediately as certain feelings of energy. Others may not experience immediate sensation yet they too are receiving conditioning and their physical vehicles are becoming more closely attuned to the conditioning wave. There are many reasons why some people experience variations in the conditions however it is sent and it is received.

## [April 3, 1974, Wednesday Meditation](en/1974/1974_0403)


> Hatonn: We wish to give a few thoughts at this time. You may remember in reading the holy work which you call the Bible that the master known as Jesus had a simple reaction to the upsetting type of illusion which he faced. His reaction was to inform it that it was an illusion. When he was confronted with a very stormy sea, he said “Peace. Be still.” And by understanding that the difficulty was an illusion that vision caused his own reality to become peaceful and still.

> Hatonn: There are many of our craft that have been seen in your skies, however, shortly more of our craft will be seen. For shortly it will be necessary for us to advertise our presence. This we will do. Primarily by being visible in your skies. This will alert many of your people to our presence, many who have heard of us previously, but who have not considered our presence of any importance.

## [March 28, 1974, Thursday Meditation](en/1974/1974_0328)


> Hatonn: This instrument has been able, as have been others, to become aware of our thoughts as we direct them to him. This is the normal way of communicating. The method used by the people of your planet is not at all normal. The Tower of Babel referred to in your Bible refers to the loss of ability of the people at that time to communicate with each other, using what you call telepathy. Telepathy is the normal technique for communication. It is simply that it is necessary to be in tune with the intended expression of love that created this universe to be able to use what you would call telepathy as it was intended.

> Hatonn: I am the one known to you as Hatonn. And yet, I am many. I identify myself to you as Hatonn, and yet, this does not mean what it means upon the surface of your planet. I am Hatonn, but what does this mean? Does it mean that I am a man, who resides elsewhere and speaks to you now using a technique you have come to know as telepathy? Or does it mean something else?

## [March 23, 1974, Saturday Meditation](en/1974/1974_0323)


> Hatonn: It is, my friends, understanding that we feel to be the most valuable commodity that we can offer you. Our understanding has enabled us to do some things which those upon the surface of the planet upon which you now live do not [enjoy]. We can understand miraculous things, which are not miraculous at all to us, and [that] we can promise to anyone who wishes to seek are not miracles [and] may become natural things. And how do we do this? Indirectly, my friends. We wish to give a way of understanding; we do not wish to insist or to convince.

Consider this, my friends, it is indeed a service, one in which we wish to help you any we can for you to channel our thoughts directly. But, my friends, are we not all channels, always in all our aspects do we not demonstrate something? What, my friends, do you demonstrate?

> Hatonn: There is much confusion upon the surface of the Earth. And it is a privilege indeed to be communicating with those who are seeking. The light that you see during the day is in fact beauty and power. You and your brothers and I and my brothers and each individual (inaudible) share this reality. In meditation you come, do not bring your intellect, my friends. Drop it, put it down. It will not serve you, it will only beguile you. Relax, meditate and if you wish us to serve you it is our greatest please to be with you and help in any way that we can.

> Hatonn: There are many things that affect a contact such as this one. This instrument has learned through practice to be able to clear his mind of the thoughts that he became involved in in his normal daily activities. It is necessary, if a good contact such as this one be made, that the thoughts that concern the daily activities of the individual or any other thoughts be erased from the consciousness for the period of the contact.

> Hatonn: Man on Earth has very little understanding of his life. The life of an individual is not what he thinks that it is. Very few of those who dwell upon your planet have any understanding of life. Man upon planet Earth is concerned with a life that is limited by his waking hours, during a present physical lifetime. His plans, his desires, and his activities are governed by his awareness of this extremely limited portion of experience, what he considers his physical life.

> Hatonn: I and my brothers are here only to serve you, my friends. And it is a very great pleasure to be here. We offer conditioning to those of you who desire this. We serve you, and we seek. Serving is seeking. The two words seem different: to seek and to serve. One suggests that you need something, and one suggests that you have something, for those who seek must need, and those who serve must have, to give away.

> Hatonn: I would speak to you this evening on a subject that I am sure each of you is interested. It is the subject of our contact with you. This contact at the present is what you know as a telepathic contact. This instrument is able to receive our thoughts. Each of you will be able to receive our thoughts as well as does this instrument in the near future. All that is necessary for you to do this is for you to avail yourself to our thoughts in meditation. There is a process of mental tuning, as you might call it, that is necessary. And this occurs while you are in meditation. It is much easier for us to contact you while you are in meditation since at that time you have rid your mind of many of the thoughts that constantly keep you from receiving what we would give to you.

For He is and you are. He and you are one and I and you are one and we are all one, beloved ones. There is nothing else but the Father and I. When you go through your daily lives, know this truth. And demonstrate it in everything that you do. For this, my friends, is that which is truth. This is the truth that you seek. This the truth that we all seek. For when we know this, my friends, there is nothing else to know.

We cannot, shall I say, go over the heads of the receivers. For this reason, we are hopeful that the grades of people who receive our communication are not too mixed.

> Hatonn: The religions of your world have, for the most part, eliminated the responsibility for individual seeking. This, however, is an extremely erroneous point of view. It is very necessary for the individual to seek truth, knowledge and the ultimate and supreme level of the Creator if he is to grow in strength and spirit and understanding and take at some future time his rightful position in the Father’s creation.

> Hatonn: This evening I would like to tell you a story. This, I believe, is an interesting story, for it has several aspects. There once was a man who dwelled upon this planet who had such wealth he had what he thought to be great security, for with his wealth he was able to do or have done whatever he wished.

These conditions will bring about much seeking among the peoples upon your surface for one reason or another. It will be that in this time there be many channels such as yourselves there to speak, using our thoughts, for we have an understanding of these conditions and of their consequence.

As I was saying, we cannot overemphasize the need to realize the truth that one only experiences what one desires.

> Hatonn: We of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator suggest that there are certain things that are important if you are to effectively meditate. The first and most important is that you allow the conscious mind to relax. It is necessary to relieve it of thoughts that are of a transient nature and we find that thoughts concerning most of the daily activities are of a transient nature.

> Hatonn: We of the Confederation of Planets are aware of the trivial nature of the things that involve most of the people of your planet. Their things seem of great importance to them. However, the importance of their activities is a function of their inability to still their active minds, and return to the awareness of reality that is possible through meditation.

> Hatonn: We realize the frustration encountered at times by those of your peoples who would seek higher spiritual life. But remember, it has been said that one makes his spirit—one makes his greatest spiritual strides during these times. Look upon your frustrations and doubt as spiritual tests. Look upon these as things to be overcome. It is a most interesting paradox that these great hardships can bring such great reward.

And they would not understand anything that we said, even though, my friends, we are able at this time to use, fluently, any of your languages. It takes a considerable amount of time, as you know it, to establish a base for communication when the concept from which we generate ideas is as largely displaced from yours as is ours. When I say “yours,” I am speaking of the general basis for concepts of the majority of the people of your planet.

> Hatonn: I am aware of your thoughts. I will attempt at this time to speak to you on a subject that would concern you. This is the subject of landing one of our craft to meet you. This instrument is at this time questioning this communication. He has always questioned communications of this nature. But I can assure him that this is a communication from the one known as Hatonn.

> Hatonn: We of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator are here for this express purpose: to serve those who seek. Our service is, unfortunately, very limited, but these limitations are limitations impressed upon us by those who are dwelling upon your planet. We are limited to use of a channel such as this one in order to serve those of the people of this planet who are seeking our service: who are seeking truth.

> Hatonn: Your desire, my friends, is the key to your existence. Your desire is extremely important, for the Creator planned that all of His children throughout all of the universe would get exactly what they desire. That is how the universe works. That is how the Creator planned it.

## [February 3, 1974, Sunday Meditation](en/1974/1974_0203)


> Hatonn: There is no necessity to establish within one’s thinking an appreciation of self. For this presupposes that it is possible to separate self from the entire creation. If one appreciates any part of the creation, then one appreciates self, for they are one and the same thing. The elimination of the concept of self is an important one in your spiritual seeking. It is necessary only to appreciate the Creator and His product, the creation. In appreciating any part of the Creation, one must appreciate all parts, for they are inseparable.

> Hatonn: Service, my friends, is an extremely difficult task to perform effectively. It is necessary first to define the objectives of true service in order to understand how one may serve. There are two classifications under which all services may be divided. The first classification includes those services that are of a transient or unlasting nature. These are the services that you perform in your daily activities for your fellow man, and they are truly services.

> Hatonn: We have stated this to you, but at this time I wish to state it once more: to serve you is to serve ourselves. This truth is not only what you might call a philosophical truth, it is also a truth that is of a direct physical nature. Its origins, although [they] may lie within the realms of the philosophical nature of the creation, do in fact take their action within what you know as the physical or material expressions of the creation.

> Hatonn: I and my brothers in space, as you call it, are here with you. Yes, we are here in space, and we are also here. This is a concept that is not too familiar with your peoples, that it is possible to be in more than one place at one time. However, we have told you that there is only one place. There is an ambiguity of concept when viewed from your limited state of awareness which you presently enjoy. However, it is possible to be, from your point of view, in two places or many places at one time. To us, they are all the same place.

> Hatonn: I would like to speak with you today about a subject that concerns your very near future. I would first like to speak to you about the definition of this term, “future.” You see the future as something that will come to you. We see the future as an event that is presently here. This is a difficult thing to translate into your language, but I will attempt to give you an understanding of what you know as time.

> Hatonn: We of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator have used this method of contact in many, many places, with many, many people. Upon your planet at present there are people in almost all areas that are receiving our communications. There are many of these people who do not understand what is happening to them. They do not understand who we are, as do you. They simply receive communications. The reason they have no idea who we are is that they have no concept of people coming to them from the stars.

> Hatonn: Why are your people at this time not very interested in these thoughts? We have said, time and time again, that thoughts of this nature are what the people of this planet need. And yet they show very little interest. This puzzled us at first, until we became more familiar with the reasons for the thinking of the population in general of this planet. We are now aware of some of the problems involved in bringing truth and understanding to a people so very long in the darkness that has been generated by those that have gone before them in the history of this planet.

> Hatonn: My friends, of what substance is the universe made? We have told you that this substance is light. You may also call this substance energy, vibration [or] consciousness. And yet, my friends, by itself, this substance, this fundamental unitary substance would remain in an uncorporate state. The shaping force, my friends, is love.

> Hatonn: We of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator are preparing to launch a new attack upon your planet, an attack of love. If one is to attack with love, it is necessary that it be done with utmost care. The only possibility, if one is to attack with love, is that the ones attacked desire that they be attacked. More and more of the people of your planet have become aware of this attack. More and more of them are now welcoming this attack. For this reason, it is possible to accelerate our program.

> Hatonn: This instrument receives my thoughts, and relays them to you. These thoughts are not my exclusive property. They are the thoughts of an entire creation of our infinite Creator. It is not necessary for the instrument to be used for you to know these thoughts. They are available to all people in all places at all times, for they are the thoughts of the Creator. And these thoughts were meant for all of mankind, in all places. These thoughts are the thoughts with which the Creator created us.

> Hatonn: We are here to serve you. We will be here to serve you. We have been here to serve you. We are here to serve all of the people who wish our service. We cannot presume that our service is of value to all people in all places. Therefore, we can only offer what we have. You must accept or reject. Sometimes, you wonder why we give you what you might consider to be relatively elementary material, or material that is repeated. We do this because this is what it needed. In actuality, this is all that is needed. It is only necessary to learn to think in the original way planned by the Creator of us all to totally benefit from all of His gifts.

## [January 14, 1974, Monday Meditation](en/1974/1974_0114)


> Hatonn: It has been the practice of the people of this planet to separate their thinking from the thinking of others. This is not a common situation. It is not a necessary situation. It is a false illusion. It is very simple, my friends, to rid yourselves of the illusion that your mind is a separate and unique entity. It is very easy to establish contact with us in the same way that this instrument has. It is only necessary that you first become aware of the creation in its true essence. This causes a variation in the attunement of your mind.

> Hatonn: I am speaking to you from a craft known to you as an “otevana.” It is a very, very large craft compared to your standards. It is several miles in length. We have been aboard this craft here above your planet for some numbers of years. It is like a world in itself, and is used for intergalactic travel. Aboard this craft we have all of the facilities that you have in your world, plus many others.

> Hatonn: We, the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator, are waiting to meet as many of the people of your planet as would wish to meet us. The reaction of the people of your planet is quite varied [as] to their realization of our presence. Some of them seem convinced that we are here now. Some of them do not believe in us at all. That is exactly the condition for which we have strived. It is a condition which will produce a maximum effort on the part of the individual to seek: to seek the truth of our existence, or of our nonexistence. This seeking will lead him upon other ideas. These ideas have been presented in many forms in your literature in the past many hundreds of years.

This craft has been seen by some of your people. It will shortly be seen by more of them. It may shortly be seen by yourselves, if you look for it. The time is closely approaching now when we must be seen much, much more by the people of this planet.

The people of your planet do not seem to recognize truth as easily as the other peoples of which I just spoke. The peoples of your planet are quite hypnotized by a false illusion created by themselves.

We are here now because it is time for us to be here. Things are progressing now that we have spoken of previously. You will see many changes in the coming year. These changes will be both of a natural type and a man-made type. There are certain things that will take place. But do not be alarmed, for you will be with the Creator.
