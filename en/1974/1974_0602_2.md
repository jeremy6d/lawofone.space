<p>I am Hatonn. I greet you, my friends, once more in the love and the light of our infinite Creator. It is a great privilege to be with you this evening. It is a great privilege to meet with you any time that you desire our contact. We of the planet Hatonn are here to serve you. Avail yourself of our service. You desire it and we bring it with love and a deep desire to serve all of those of the planet Earth who would avail themselves.</p>
<p>We are going to at this time establish contact with the newer channels of this group in hopes that they will generate proficiency. At this time I will transfer this contact. I am Hatonn.</p>

<p>I am now with this instrument. We wish to express our joy in the progress of such new instruments as this one. I wish to speak to you tonight upon a matter in which <em>(inaudible)</em> may be <em>(inaudible)</em> assistance to those new instruments who may desire our aid in the progress of their channeling. We have oftentimes <em>(inaudible)</em> that your progress increases with the [volume] of your desire. Through your desire you obtain the knowledge with which to guide you through the trials in which all instruments who choose to serve the Creator must serve. For you see, the road is always difficult but through your meditation you are given the strength with which you are to bear these trials and yet with each trial you gain further faith and further knowledge of the Creator.</p>
<p>It is somewhat a difficult task to devote individual attention to all of those who desire it at this point. Therefore, we have developed new devices in which, once developed in awareness of your desire, we may share with you our love at any time you so desire. We wish to express our love for all the peoples of your planet and our desire to serve you. All who wish this desire, the choice is in the individual, for it is said and it is true that every being on your Earth is of their own free will [and] can make of their lives what they may.</p>
<p>I would like to at this time attempt to condition those new instruments in this room at this time if it be of their desire. I might add that it’s <em>(inaudible)</em> to say do not be afraid to say this thought for the thought you may have is often mistaken as being of the fault. Do not have fear of mistakes for it is a common occurrence in the lives of all the beings of your planet and also, I might add, it’s the fault in which all of God’s children may <em>(inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I shall at this time attempt to condition those who may desire. I am Hatonn.</p>

<p>I am Hatonn. I am now with this instrument. It is indeed a great honor to be with again a new instrument. I would now like to proceed upon the subject of inspiration. Inspiration is indeed what takes almost all things you obtain to come true.</p>
<p>I have experienced some difficulty with this instrument. I will now continue. As you go about your life on your planet there is indeed a great illusion.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Unknown channeling)</p>
<p>I am Hatonn. I am again with this instrument. I should like to continue. I was speaking of your need for inspiration for it is the inspiration in which you need to bring about the will to desire the knowledge or whatever you may seek in the name of the Creator, for it is when it is used as a service of the Creator a most worthy power of suggestion that can be offered. We wish to convey a short message pertaining to the development of these, shall I say, cosmic powers. Through your meditation may we gain much knowledge. We wish to stress the need not only for your group meditation, which is good for the development of your intellect, but we also must stress your need for silent meditation for it is within this that you gain the knowledge in which is needed for your daily life in the service of the Creator.</p>
<p>I would like at this time to make contact with any entity who will avail themselves. I am Hatonn.</p>

<p>I am Hatonn. I am again with this instrument. I will <em>(inaudible)</em> on the subject of influences. You as a person living on your planet are subject to many influences. We in some way hope to bring about small things that will help influence your mind as to the power of the infinite Creator. But at the same time we do not wish to get, as you say, carried away. I and my brothers only wish to make it possible for you and those of you that wish to know to have certain information at your disposal. It is indeed a great honor for us to be able to do this. I and my brothers are extremely proud of the great number of you who are making themselves available. I sincerely hope that in the near future it will be possible to give better messages to those who have not experienced channeling for <em>(inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I am aware of the uncertainness in the ones … one known as G. I will at this time attempt to establish contact with her if she desires. I would like to say to her that she relax completely. I am Hatonn.</p>
<p class="comment">(Pause)</p>
<p>I am experiencing trouble in establishing contact so I would at this time like to close. It has been a very great honor to talk to some of the new channels. I am Hatonn.</p>
