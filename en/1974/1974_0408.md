<p>I am Oxal. I am with the instrument. I am sorry for the delay. It is a great privilege to be with you this evening. I am the one known to you as Oxal. I am speaking through this instrument. I am of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator. I am in a craft above your house. I am speaking to you directly from this craft. I am in this craft at this time for a particular purpose. You will become aware of this purpose as I speak to you. We of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator are here to serve. We are here to serve in more ways than one. We have primarily attempted to serve you in arousing the interest in seeking. However, shortly we must serve you in an additional way. This addition <em>(inaudible)</em> will be in a more direct way.</p>
<p>It will be necessary if we are to do this that you prepare yourselves for this meeting. This may be done by availing yourselves <em>(inaudible)</em> to meditation. We will not be able communicate with you unless you are able to avail yourself to our thoughts in meditation. We cannot contact you in the manner you are accustomed to using upon the surface of your planet. This would be of no avail. We do not have concepts in your language that we wish to convey; we have concepts that are not within your language. If you will avail yourself in meditation to us we will prepare for our <em>(inaudible)</em>, but this is essential.</p>
<p>We are going to at this time prepare each of you in a certain way. It will be obvious to you. Please be patient for a few moments.</p>

<p><em>(Inaudible)</em>. As we do this, feel the rhythm … the rhythm of your breath <em>(inaudible)</em> as it slowly becomes one with all that surrounds you. This realization is important. It is a major step towards reaching a new level of consciousness for the peoples of your planet. Only then can you begin to experience <em>(inaudible)</em> level of vibration of this planet … of this planet Earth but only if there … It is important to master the technique if we are truly communicating <em>(inaudible)</em>. All the peoples of your planet have this potential if they so desire it. We realize that it is sometimes difficult for the level of your awareness <em>(inaudible)</em> is small beginning in the realm of the creation but, my friends, <em>(inaudible)</em> if you so desire it. There are no rules that omit any one of you <em>(inaudible)</em> with the growth if any within your group <em>(inaudible)</em> begin to feel.</p>
<p>This road is an individual road. The growth, my friends, is a vibration which can be felt by all of the peoples around you. We of the Confederation of Planets in Service to the Infinite Creator are very concerned about the course your planet has chosen to follow. When we speak of planet we speak of the peoples of your planet for they do represent the vibration of the creative intelligence of life. My friends, if you are to survive you must grow. It is our wish to help you grow … to transcend the vibration of hate and replace it with one of love. For love is all there is, my friends. This is the mainstay of all creation. We offer it to you. You must learn to offer it to all of you … to all of those around you. Only as you begin this course will you help. Your planet, my friends, is in the midst of many changes. These changes will affect your lives in many ways. I know it is hard for you to understand, but you must trust for we do bring love.</p>
