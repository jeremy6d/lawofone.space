<p><strong>Jim:</strong> The following information refers again to Carla’s two experiences with LSD. We were very thankful that there were only two experiences with which she and we had to deal, for, as you can see, the debilitating effects apparently mount rapidly with each ingestion. The sessions in Book Two of <em>The Law Of One</em> were necessarily shortened in order to conserve the vital energy of the instrument which had been drained by the LSD.</p>
<p><strong><em>Carla:</em></strong><em> I can only add the fact that this period of weakness did occur, and so Ra’s suggestion not to mix any drugs with channeling seems to me a sound piece of advice that I have followed ever since.</em></p>
<p class="transcript-sub-title">Session 26, February 17, 1981</p>
<p><strong>Questioner:</strong> The instrument asks how long will the debilitating effects that I am experiencing due to the LSD last, and is there anything that we can do to make the instrument more comfortable?</p>
<p><strong>Ra:</strong> I am Ra. Firstly, the period of weakness of bodily complex is approximately three of your lunar cycles, the first ingestion causing approximately one of your lunar cycles; the second having a cumulative or doubling effect.</p>
