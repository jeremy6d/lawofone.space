<p><strong>Jim:</strong> However, our curiosity did periodically return. And, once again, we see the importance of maintaining one’s free will by not diluting the present incarnational experience with too much information concerning one’s previous experiences. Meditations and lives tend to be more efficient if they remain focused upon one point or moment.</p>
<p><strong><em>Carla:</em></strong><em> We have spent a few moments of our lives thinking about who was fifth-density and who was sixth, but it has never been clear, nor have we been much pushed to figure it out!</em></p>

<p><strong>Questioner:</strong> Is it possible, since we are Wanderers, for you to tell us anything about which our last density was, which density we came from?</p>
<p><strong>Ra:</strong> I scan each and find it acceptable to share this information. The Wanderers in this working are of two densities, one the density of five; that is, of light; one the density of love/light, or unity. To express the identity of which came from which density, we observe this to be an infringement upon the free will of each. Therefore, we state simply the two densities, both of which are harmoniously oriented towards work together.</p>
