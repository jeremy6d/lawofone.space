<p>I am Hatonn, and greet you once again. At this time it is our privilege to offer ourselves in service by attempting to answer questions. Are there any questions at this time?</p>
<p><strong>Questioner:</strong> <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I am Hatonn, and am aware of your question, my brother. Healing, basically, is a function of the one to be healed desiring to be healed. Those who wish to aid in this process may do so in a number of manners. For those present in this group we would suggest that the method most accessible and useful be done in the meditative state where the one to be healed is imaged in the mind in the condition which needs healing. This condition is seen in as much detail as is possible for the one wishing to be of service. When it is seen as clearly as is possible, then it is replaced by another image. This image being of the one to be healed in the healed condition, surrounded by love and light, seeing every part of the one to be healed body surrounded by this love and light, a glowing effect. This condition is also imaged in as much detail as is possible for the one wishing to be of service. It is recommended, though not completely essential, that each image be maintained for a number of your minutes. Then, that the images be released so that higher forces, so to speak, might take them over and fill in the flesh on the bone, shall we say, of this image.</p>
<p>The healing process, in general, is a process whereby the one to be healed accepts the healing energy which is ever present within its own being, always entering its being through the feet and the lower chakras or energy centers. The one to be healed, therefore, makes a decision either to accept this energy which is ever present, as well as energy which is transferred or sent from another, and if this energy is accepted then there is a new configuration evident within the one to be healed which is what you call the healed condition or health.</p>
<p>In all cases, we emphasize that the healing is done by the one to be healed. Others may serve as what you might call a catalyst for this action and this acceptance, but there is no possibility of another entity healing the one to be healed unless the one to be healed accepts this offering. In the final analysis, so to speak, it is the Creator who does the healing, the Creator residing within the one <em>(inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my brother?</p>
<p><strong>Questioner:</strong> <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>We thank you as well. Is there another question at this time?</p>
<p><strong>Questioner:</strong> <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I am Hatonn, and am aware of your question, my brother. In this regard we might once again recommend that the meditative state be used for visualization of this anger and the one to whom it is being sent and for whom it is being generated. In your visualization see this entity receiving your anger and see the effect upon this entity of such a reception. See in your mind your own identification with this entity. See this entity as yourself as you receive the anger which you have generated for this entity. See this anger entering this entity’s being which is now your own being as well. Feel the effects of this emotion which you call anger within your being. Experience its nature. Carry it to its logical, as you would say, conclusion in your mind and in your visualization. Allow this image to remain within your mind for a period of time. Determine by the intensity of the anger <em>(inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>When you feel that your anger has been spent and has been felt in full, then for a moment in your mind image its opposite. Then let that image disappear and let it be, shall we say, a small beacon which you shall approach by a process of what we will call natural discovery. Remaining in the meditative state, continue to see in your mind the entity for which you feel anger and, seeing this entity still in a dual nature, being the other and being your self.</p>
<p>As you see this image make no attempt to guide it either toward the anger or its opposite, towards love, but allow your being to proceed through this natural discovery, until you feel the love which you imaged momentarily filling your being, which is also the being of the other. Allow this feeling of love to overwhelm your senses in the same manner and degree in which the anger did so. When this has been achieved, see both emotions, the anger and the love, in your mind as imbalance. See the imbalance of anger, but see the balance of anger and love. Then accept yourself and forgive yourself and see yourself as whole and complete as is the Creator, which you are, and see yourself experiencing both emotions as means by which the Creator might know Itself.</p>

<p>We thank you for this opportunity to be of service. Is there another question at this time?</p>
<p class="comment">(Pause)</p>
<p>I am Hatonn. We are aware of several unasked questions and will once again allow for their asking, for we feel it is an infringement upon free will to respond to any query which has not been spoken. Are there any further questions at this time?</p>
<p><strong>Questioner:</strong> <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I am Hatonn. My brother, in this regard we may speak in general by saying that the structures of which you speak had their origin within the minds of a small group of adepts who were of the nature of deep religious seekers and who sought to express the grandeur and richness which was their personal experience through the medium of the architectural design and layout of these structures so that by certain geometric relationships future generations of seekers and worshippers might be inspired by the beauty, the grace, and the richness of design to increase their seeking of the one Creator.</p>
<p>It is true in these cases as it is also true in many such cases of the designs of the places of worship in your ancient of times, that those few seekers who had attained some small part of their goal of union with the one Creator put their findings, the crystallizations of their learning, shall we say, in a geometric or architectural form serving much as what you know as pyramids, to funnel, focus and intensify the ever present instreamings of intelligent energy or that which is known in your eastern philosophies as prana, into certain patterns which would be of assistance in their seeking of union with the one Creator. Many such structures are aiding those who worship inside their walls to this day because of efforts of the few in ancient of times of your peoples.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my brother?</p>
<p><strong>Questioner:</strong> <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I am Hatonn, and in this regard, my brother, we might say that you are correct, for it is well known to those who are deep religious seekers of truth who have attained some part of that goal of union with the Creator, that all is one and as it has been said many times in your religious history, “As it is above, so it is below.”</p>
<p>There are certain relationships, balances and regularities in the relation of different parts or aspects of the mind to itself and to other minds, expanding outward to the master mind and cosmic mind or the mind of the one infinite Creator. There are certain geometric relationships that might also be seen in a geographical nature as well. In this regard there is upon your planet a knowledge of certain structures or forms which aid the seeking of the religious adopt. These forms may be seen to be of a vaulted or a conical nature, that which is similar to the pyramid, the dome or the arch and such structures have been utilized throughout your history and before your written history for the purpose of increasing the focus of the instreamings of the one Creator in a certain area which is to be used for the seeking or sacred ritual of seekers. In many cases these designs or structures are copied from earlier times and earlier structures and indeed are reproductions of forms which have existed previously upon your planet. In other cases these structures are arrived at by individual or original means of inspiration, shall we say, and though they are similar in design to the previous structure, bear the <em>(inaudible)</em> mark of one for their inspiration.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my brother?</p>
<p><strong>Questioner:</strong> <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I am Hatonn. The structure which you refer to as the flying buttress is indeed an extension of a design which incorporates the pyramid or arch type of structure and is necessary to complete the funneling or focusing of the prana energy.</p>
<p>May we answer you further, my brother?</p>
<p><strong>Questioner:</strong> <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>We are most grateful to you as well. Is there another question at this time?</p>
<p><strong>Questioner:</strong> <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p>I am Hatonn, and in this regard, my sister, we would suggest that your planet is populated with a multitude of entities, each of whom is in the greatest of need …</p>
