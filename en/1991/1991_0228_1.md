<p>The Aaron/Q’uo Dialogues are a series of co-channeling sessions done by Barbara Brodsky, channeling Aaron, and Carla L. Rueckert, channeling the Q’uo group. The material was received during a series of nine weekend gatherings, seven of them being held at L/L Research near Louisville, Kentucky and the other two being held at Deep Springs Center, Barbara’s non-profit group, near Ann Arbor, Michigan. These gatherings spanned about a decade of time.</p>
<p>Our objectives in co-channeling were three. We wished to produce material helpful to spiritual seekers. We wished to demonstrate that positively oriented channels can work together without ego. And we wished to demonstrate that positive information harmonizes, even when the sources of that information seem to come from profoundly different traditions. Aaron, a Buddhist master in his final incarnation, 500 years ago, is now an inner-planes guide. The Q’uo group are an ET source, part of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator.</p>
<p>This material is now in the process of being edited for a printed book. Meanwhile, we felt it would be a good service to put the drafts of these sessions up so that you could use them. Aaron and Q’uo, Barbara and Carla all hope that you may read the material with as much enjoyment as we experienced in producing it.</p>
<p>With L/L – Barbara and Carla</p>
