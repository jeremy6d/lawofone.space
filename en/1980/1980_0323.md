<p>I am Hatonn, and I greet you in the love and the light of the infinite Creator. We are very happy to be able to serve you … for we of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator have no other wish except to share our thoughts with you for whatever aid they may be to you in your isolation for the path that you most desire to walk in this most dense illusion that you call Earth. You walk in darkness. It is now dark about your dwelling place but through this instrument’s ears she hears a branch of your … into a sort … nourishing plants that have also borne your darkness will now come … We would suggest that you remember that your entire life as you now perceive it is only … You will see that which is truly light as you leave this earthly … which you call. And yet you have that light within you just as the caterpillar has the butterfly, for you see, to fly … We ask you to think this night, my friends, of … It is written in your holy work that the master whom you call Jesus the Christ was come into the world by leaving so much darkness … and … He was an example of light. That, is he was an example of realized consciousness. You yourselves take for granted many limitations but find you are imprisoned in a kind of spiritual darkness which separates you from the light. What you accept as reality, those things about you … to you are less than … as we are … for yours is a world of illusion. That is why we wish to speak to you about light. For only the warmth … light from darkness has borne … to take for granted that … all those things which … The lesson that you learn while you are within this creation of darkness you learn by choosing one … the light. Reaching toward … Yet how difficult it is to do that for … It would seem … that evil … that the … it is to … But we would take you into a country … We would take you into … where all offices are the same for that which is justice is … We would take you beyond … beyond … all … Just as … will not. So your, finally … a paradox which is an ultimate … Thus while you are lonely … the age-old … thoughts what country while your spirit … and you … of light … I am conditioning this instrument … We are with you … We … are called … but we dwell … standing … We are not … We would now at this time transfer … you would feel … I am again with this instrument. We ask that … it is … strengthen your … We encourage you in your meditation … and assure you that we will be with you … We will … another member of the Confederation to speak with you. I am known to you as …</p>

<p>I am Laitos, and I too greet you in the love and light of the infinite Creator. It is my especial privilege to work with those who wish to become instruments and to help each of you with the conditioning process. So if you will be patient with the new instruments we would like to work with each of you. We would like to send energy to the one known as C. We are aware that he is fatigued but we would like to attempt to let him be aware of our vibrations if he would.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>I am again with this instrument. We can feel a great deal of, shall we say, improvement in the reception of the one known as C. We understand that he is … by questions and doubts as to our basic origin and … This is entirely proper. We hope that as time goes on he will in addition to … allow the process of opening … will requestion information and pursue his attempts to understand at any level he may desire. … At this time we would like to attempt to speak a few words through the one known as … if she would relax … I am Laitos.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>I am again with this instrument. We would like to adjust the energy which we have given to … adjust our vibrations and again attempt to speak a few words through the one known as … if she would …</p>
<p>We thank the one known … We ask you, my sister, not to feel badly because we … for our thoughts … but it does take time … we are aware … greatly desire to we … We would like to now work with the one known … if she would … she would … herself that which she thinks without attempting analysis as to whether it is her thought or simply learn a concept into the instrument’s …</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>I am again with this instrument. We are aware that the instrument known as M … next time we attempt to make our presence known to her by …</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>I am again with this instrument. We thank the one known as M and offer ourselves to her any time that she wishes to receive the particular service of … only one of … times that … so much of the wisdom … other sources for a relief from … of your … If you will be patient we would like to work with the instrument known … We have difficulty … would like to attempt … she would relax … I will transfer to the one known as K. I am Laitos.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>I am again with this instrument. To the one known as K we would say you have just received a … that was ours and will again send it and ask that … be brave … speak forth you will discover that if your thoughts …</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>I am again with this instrument. We thank our sister K for working with us. We know that it is difficult for you to allow your mind to … hear … contact … through this type of overture. We know that it takes practice and confidence … And with time as you call it … We are glad … Thank you … our love … If wish to receive … simply mentally request … If you are receiving conditioning … I am Laitos … Adonai.</p>

<p>I am Latwii. I come to this group only to wish you well for I do not have a great deal to say to you at this time. This instrument is expecting me to give her some wise and inspirational thought but, my friends, you are the inspiration. It is your understanding of this that will save you, not our words. You must think of yourselves as the fence that intertwines one strand with another, forming great strength so that flowers may grow over it and winds may never blow it over. Alone you are only a … seeing the cosmos and the cosmos seeing you. Hold out your hand to your brother, my friend.</p>
<p>What an inspiration. We cannot give you that inspiration for you are the inspiration. You are the Creator. We are only a voice given through a channel coming from a dimension that is not distant. We are like thoughts that you may think yourself. You must understand that we of the Confederation in no way wish that you become champions of the so-called UFO’s. For we do not think of our philosophy as being the truth of the Creator, for we as you and all the beings that there are are the Creator. We are speaking to ourselves … But you are living in a density in which you have tremendous capacity to learn. You learn from sorrow, you learn from … you can learn from any means … always remember, the inspiration, the answers are within you. There is no outside input. Like you … by becoming conscious are truly one …</p>
<p>We ask you to do this, my friends, of course in meditation, but we feel that you are an advanced group to the point where you have realized that meditation is not a … You can meditate and then five minutes later … The next lesson, my friends, is not … The next lesson, my friends, is that you realize who you are. To be in such a state that you are the inspiration to the outer world that you truly are … Let yourself be free, to be joyful, to share that joy with others. You have something to give that is so precious that it cannot be described. … For you will never be alone for you are on a path which is shared by many, many … There is a kind of interweaving … so that you can never be alone. You walk with the Creator and with all those who seek the Creator. Imagine, my friends, the loneliness of those … who do not know that they are the child of the Creator. Yet they are. They are part of the great and perfect union that is …</p>
<p>Well, my friends, I speak a long time for someone who has nothing to say and I apologize if I speak too long. But I come basically to ask if there are questions, for I would be very happy to attempt to help you understand … Questions?</p>
<p><strong>Questioner:</strong> <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>My friend, we understand your question, however, it is very easy to speak of … it is in fact something that you do very well. However, due to your analyzing … Therefore let us say a bit about the condition … no entirely … Conditioning acts as a kind of a carrier wave which strengthens the signal of your own so-called alpha wave … It is a basic meditative frequency … to … shall we say brain … although … But this instrument would … channel information. When you meditate … wish to seek conditioning, simply ask for … This job is given to our brother Laitos and it is felt in various ways. For those who do not wish to channel … electricity, shall we say … some part of the body. … you can see … If someone wishes to use the conditioning in order to become a vocal channel, simply mention … mentally to us and Laitos will then work with more intensity … on your vocal … into your muscle … exercising you … objective evidence that there is an entity that is not yourself that is … activity. When you have become sufficiently conditioned to, shall we say, believe in us, which is an almost literal thing, then your belief that there is something to receive has given you enough confidence to allow you to speak thoughts as they are given to you without analyzing … then … will … vocal channel … we will be gone as quickly as … Some develop very quickly, some develop slowly. It is usually the analysis of our thoughts that keeps the instrument from developing more rapidly. Thus, as you receive conditioning, if you will refrain from analysis, then simply accept whatever … you are feeling, when the vibration is transferred to you, you will be in much better position to have the confidence … to speak without knowing what is to come next. For this is … not knowing what they are going to say next, they do not say what they are feeling … thus they are not able to receive … Do you understand what we are speaking …? How may we help you?</p>
<p><strong>Questioner:</strong> <em>(Inaudible)</em>.</p>
<p class="channel-type">(Carla channeling)</p>
<p>That is indeed correct, my brother. And yet if you have ever watched … you know that every … respond with … For … surrounds all … We will give you another image which may help you. … is something … there is no … All of those things … Perhaps this will aid you … sincerely …</p>
