> Group question: The question today comes from B and S. B was wondering if a social memory complex possesses a kind of consciousness that can engage in the exchange of energy with its members, either consciously or unconsciously, or if it is simply the sum of its members? We were assuming (in our conversation previous to this meditation) that a social memory complex could indeed engage in conversation of a very intimate and continuous nature with all of its members. If that is true, could you expand upon that, and could you let us know? And as S asks: As we are beginning to form a social memory complex, is there anything that we can do to prime the pump towards positivity in service-to-others acts, attitudes of mind, meditations, rituals, anything at all?

> Group question: (Our question today is from B.) It is my understanding that the formation of a social memory complex is crucial to fourth-density existence, and that the human race, due to factors already cited in The Ra Material, has been unable to even begin to form a social memory complex. My question is: What would be the areas of study, and the mental and spiritual disciplines required, of a dedicated group of people who wish to form a social memory complex in preparation for harvest?

> Group question: The question today has to do with why human beings in the third density, especially here on Earth, seem to be so war-like. In this particular system we have had the experience of Mars, which was apparently so war-like that they destroyed their atmosphere. Maldek exploded its planet. Earth has had thousands of years of war. We are wondering what it is about the third density that seems to lend itself to entities in it moving in the direction of war-like actions. Is it the nature of our consciousness interacting in social groups? Is it our free will choice? Is it our opposable thumb? Our ability to make and use tools and, therefore, weapons? We would appreciate anything Q’uo could tell us about what it is that gives us this propensity for war and what it is we need to do as individuals, groups and nations to move in the direction of cooperation and working together instead of against each other?

> Group question: The question today, once again, is focused around the events of September 11th. We are wondering if you could give us some information about [whether] the people who were directly involved and who gave their lives in this event might have been the catalyst for all of us to become what you might call a “nation of priests,” people who are desirous of being of service to others and following the way of the peaceful warrior, of discovering love in the life, in the heart and sharing it with others. Could you elaborate on how this kind of catalyst can work in all of our lives and how we can become a “nation of priests”?

> Group question: Our question today has to do with fear. Before September 11th, everybody had the normal fears of having enough money, food, friendships, harmonious work relationships, and so forth. Now there seems to be a general tenor for many people of a foreboding, a fear, that there might be more attacks, that we are not safe, that we are losing our freedoms, that something is going to get us. We are wondering if Q’uo could give us some information concerning how we can handle our fears? How can fear best be handled by the sincere spiritual seeker? Is there a way of changing our attitudes, our behavior, our thinking? We would appreciate whatever Q’uo has to say.

> Group question: The question today has to do with the healing meditations that you recommended a couple of weeks ago in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11 and various other places on the planet which are full of anger and war and hatred, famine, poverty, disease and so forth. We would like to know a couple of more ways that a person could use to send love and light to all the areas, the people, the places that need it.

> Group question: The question today has to do with the concept of the “light-bringer,” the knowledge-bringer, whether this is Lucifer that was the knowledge-bringer or the light-bringer, or Eve who gave Adam the apple from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, we are wondering if Q’uo could give us some information about the nature of these entities, or these qualities that bring knowledge. Are these entities themselves either good or evil? How does the concept that they deliver to us give us the ability to pursue that which is good or evil, service-to-self or service-to-others? Last week Q’uo gave us some information concerning the Lightning Struck Tower which is also a concept or an image that shows light in its sudden and fiery form causing what seems to be destruction. We are wondering if there is other fruit from this destruction? Can something positive come out of the Lightning Struck [Tower] and, literally, the towers in New York City that were destroyed?

> Group question: The question today, Q’uo, as I am sure that you already know, concerns the recent acts of terrorism that have come to the United States. Many people have died, and much property has been destroyed and there is a lot of talk about retribution, about war, and a lot of fear and anger, a lot of confusion. And we are wondering what this situation looks like from Q’uo’s point of view. We are told that this world is an illusion. It is a place where we come to learn to love. From our point of view, right here, right now, it is a very difficult place to learn to love. We are wondering what Q’uo can add to our knowledge of just exactly what has occurred, what does it mean to us in the spiritual sense, and what can we as individuals do to help the situation?

> Group question: The question today has to do with the situation concerning our planet and all of us who inhabit it. We would like for Q’uo to give us some information concerning the quality of consciousness on our planet when you consider the various wars, diseases, famines, and crises that occur on a daily basis as each of us as individuals go about our daily lives, dealing with the various levels of stress of family, work, community and so forth. We are wondering how we as individuals find a centering point, the joy in the moment? How can we really be of service to each other and to ourselves?

> Question from R: This first question concerns [a] pattern in my life that has to do with feelings about my work. My criticism of myself is that my work should be more service-to-others oriented. I then proceed to find a different type of work or employment that has energy in it that grabs me and that I start working with it but that passion or that energy dissipates quickly once that new work begins. I am looking for suggestions or different points of view that would help me get deeper into this pattern that I am seeing.

> Group question: The question today has to do with the process of growth that the spiritual seeker seems to go through. We would like for Q’uo to give us some idea about the nature of this process. Most of the time, when something happens internally, we may or may not feel the repercussions externally in our life. We are wondering if Q’uo could give us an idea of how this process of change occurs, the various types of change, the stages of change, the ways the seeker can use to survive the change. And could Q’uo give us an idea of how the process and practice of meditation enhance this change?

> Group question: The question today has to do with the eternal spiritual principles that each seeker of truth pursues. At some point in the spiritual journey a seeker will lose some of the original passion that propelled the seeking to begin with, and we would like Q’uo to give us information about how the seeker can find again that passion in the seeking. How can we as seekers of truth keep our passion high, or is it necessary to have periods of rest?

And when you feel a strong emotion in desiring to close a relationship, is there anything that you can do internally for yourself that doesn’t involve another person? How much of this is an internal process?

> Group question: Today our question concerns the fact that we reincarnate from life to life with friends, time after time, in clans or groups, and learn to serve and seek the Creator with them. We are wondering how this process of reincarnation in groups affects the planetary consciousness. Does it aid the planet and how does that work? How does this process aid the individual harvest when that time comes?

Many of them likely are wanderers or spiritual outsiders of one kind or another and we are wondering if Q’uo today would like to say something to these people about the concepts in the book or the quality of being a wanderer, of being alienated and isolated in the spiritual journey.

Or how a group can help us to develop patience in accepting things that don’t change or won’t change: a rift in a friendship, a job situation, relationships with family, etc.

And we would like for Q’uo to give us any information possible that would pertain to the healing that can be achieved by the Christian Scientist’s point of view versus the healing that can be obtained by the more traditional orthodox medicine. Would one be more likely to result in a cure? Any other comments that Q’uo could make about healing would be appreciated.

And is there really a precise answer or direction for each of us, or is there a certain amount of uncertainty that we need to be able to accept?
