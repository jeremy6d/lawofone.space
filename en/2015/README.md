> Group question: Today weâ€™d like to ask about service. How can we identify our service as positive? How can we know our actions are in line with our desire to serve? How do our intentions, desires and actions play in to our service?

> Group question: Dear Q'uo, this world is beset by recurring stories of intensive conflict, disharmony and suffering. One recent example is happening in Europe where hundreds of thousands of refugees have left their troublesome home countries to find safety, security and a new chance at life. There are a lot of welcoming energies awaiting these refugees, but also a lot of resistance and, in some places, even violent xenophobic attacks.

> Group question: In the past, those of Q'uo have drawn a distinction between the "mind of the world" and the "mind of the heart." Q'uo describes the "mind of the world" as the analytical judging mind which we have been conditioned to use almost exclusively. They describe the "mind of the heart" as being a consciousness of love.

> Group question: Q'uo, many of us are struggling with situations that seem too much to bear, at times. We have the perception of having either too much catalyst, or too intense catalyst, or both. We often feel that life places burdens upon us that we don't have the resources to cope with. How do we carry our crosses, Q'uo? How do we bring the open heart into the challenges that life seems to put upon us and invite higher energies to transform our experience?

> Group question: We'd like to know how to determine where the inner light that is our birth right in the violet ray meets with the intelligent energy from the logos that is our daily gift of energy that comes in from our base chakra, through our feet, and through the groin area; how do we determine where that meeting place is?
