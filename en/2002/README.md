> Q’uo: This query concerns the way to serve to the maximum of the ability of the one known as S. We are aware of the purity of intention of the one known as S. Further, we are aware of the resonances between this situation and situations in the past experiences of two of those within this circle, which create for us the delicacy of movement through highly charged emotional issues concerning fidelity, honor and the concept of rightness.

> Question from R: Can the source of anger, seeming this is the source of the cancer, be inherited? Can it be from past-life programming, or could it be deliberately implanted or consciously created to create a learning opportunity during the incarnation?

We would like for you to give us some information about the inhabitants there. We are aware somewhat that there are angels of a very high order, there are regular spirits that are associated with the natural world, the spirits of fire, of water, of earth, of air, and we are certain that there are others as well. We would like for you to give us an idea of the kinds of entities that inhabit the devachanic realms.

> Question from B: From my exposure to the situation here, I’m thinking that the harvest may be small, and I’m wondering if a motion picture that talks about the harvest might actually be helpful in increasing, at least potentially, the harvest size. If that is so, would it be more helpful to have a screenplay which dealt directly with the harvest, or would it be more helpful to deal with it indirectly through the growth and the learning of the characters, the story that they tell? That is the initial query.

> Group question: The question today, Q’uo, has to do with the intensity of catalyst that we feel. We’ve heard it said that most learning that is efficient takes place with some sort of trauma. We’re wondering why that is. Is it due to the intensity of the lesson we wish to learn? And is the lesson we wish to learn discernible from the catalyst that we experience, or do we need to look deeper than the catalyst we experience? We would like for you to give us some information concerning how we experience our catalyst; how we can be more efficient in using our catalyst? Is it in dealing with the catalyst itself that we see what we’re trying to learn, or do we need to meditate more to discover the lesson? Do we need to work with our dreams? Do we need to do essays? Do we need to be doing something besides just looking at the catalyst that is available in our daily lives?

> Group question: The question today, Q’uo, has to do with what is happening for the individual seeker; [what is] the metaphysical reality of what’s going on in our world today as each of us struggles to understand inner spiritual truths [while] we are caught in the swirl of economic, political, social and other activities that are just increasing at exponential rates. We’re wondering what is really going on, when you consider that the various religions of the world have all been affected in one way or another by negatively-oriented entities trying to sway our ability to believe and where we put our faith. [They] have had some success, in causing us to have thousands of years of war as the concept of the holy war is born and carried out in each of the religions. In the Old Testament, for the Christians, there was a New Testament; there was a new covenant. Jesus brought the way of loving one’s neighbor. There seems to have been for the last couple of thousand years a smaller and smaller group of people who really feel committed to the way of Christ. Could you give us an idea of just what’s happening in the way of metaphysical and spiritual evolution planet-wide and individual-wide and how our various religions and their current difficulties are being affected?

> Group question: The question today concerns the power of thought and the power of belief of the words that we speak to ourselves and the images that we create from these words and these beliefs and how this image can be changed according to how beliefs change. We would like for Q’uo to give us some information on how we can create our own images; how we can change the way we talk to ourselves, the words we speak in our minds, and the images that we see. This is, I guess, a personal mythology—the way we look at ourselves and the way we look at the world through the creation of ourselves, so anything Q’uo would have to add to this thought, we would appreciate very much.

> Group question: Our question today has to do with the concept of balancing. We hear a great deal, from many different sources, that balance is important; that we should be looking for ways to balance our lives, and, since each person lives a unique existence, we’re wondering if Q’uo could give some information on how we as individuals could determine what we need to do—each of us—to balance our lives. Is there a good general technique of meditation, of contemplation, or study that you would recommend for us to balance our lives so that the responses we make to people and to new situations are our highest and our best?

> Group question: The question today has to do with the concept of gratitude. We are told by various sources that we should give praise and thanksgiving in all things whether they be what we think are good or we think are bad, and we would like Q’uo to give us some information today about why this is so effective; why giving praise and thanksgiving in all things seems to produce so much of what we call good or the feeling of being in the right place at the right time, of being in the flow. We appreciate anything Q’uo’s got to say about giving praise and thanksgiving.

## [August 9, 2002, Special Meditation](en/2002/2002_0809)


> Question from T1: The question today is about pain and suffering, as I am experiencing pain in my nerves around the right side of my waist that leaves me sleepless and concerned about my future virility and health. Why do traumas such as pain and disease occur so often in the lives of spiritually sincere and seeking people? I know I’m a kind soul, so why would I or my higher self include pain in life? His Holiness the Dali Lama said the purpose of life is to be in happiness. I deeply agree with that. Some philosophy books taught us that pains would help us grow. I just don’t feel comfortable with such thinking. Should I just communicate with my higher self and say, “Just tell me what to do to make you and us happy?” Spare me from such a thing.

> Question from T1: “I have noticed that my human eyes are drawn by beautiful women, while I do not notice less attractive women in the same way. And I know that some beautiful women are cruel, while many unattractive women are beautiful in spirit. I feel that there is nothing wrong with appreciating physical beauty, but I cannot appreciate all women’s beauty, and furthermore I find myself fantasizing about beautiful women, even if they are spiritually mean. I find that I am failing to see all equally as the Creator. I’m quite concerned about this. Is this just me or an issue for men in general? I also wish to know about the karmic link between beauty and previous lives, as Edgar Cayce has mentioned in his trance sessions. What role or catalyst does beauty play in our soul evolution?”

> Question: This question is from T1, and his first question is concerning the possibility that Earth might be about to experience some major catastrophes in the next eight to ten months. He’s seen a number of prophesies that suggest that this could be so, and he feels that, well, if that is so, then he should be spending his time helping people to discover this and take part in the evolutionary process, and get out and be diligent and serious about his service, but, if it’s not true, if Earth is not in great danger, then he wonders should he continue to do what he likes in this life: playing games, seeing movies, going dancing in the pub. The second question is, he would like Q’uo’s comment on his current progress in soul development, and perhaps some general advice as to how to be more in harmony with the Law of One.

> Questioner: I feel difficulty in just plain loving so much of the time. What blocks have I created to the love within me? Where or how am I preventing that infinite energy from reaching my heart? What can I do to love and accept my family more? Is there anything I can do to bring healing where it is needed in this family, my father especially? I seem to be very stuck in orange-ray concerns which keep my focus on myself. What can I do to finish my own processes enough that I might place that focus outwards and work to actually serving another?

> Group question: Our question today is sort of two-pronged. The first part has to do with the energies, the spiritual vibrations, of the evolution of the planet, its population, and each of us individually as well. Some people spoke of being able to feel these vibrations more intensively now, and we are wondering if you could describe these vibrations to us, their nature, and how we could work more harmoniously with them so that they are not so overwhelming. The second part of the question was: when you speak to groups like ours, could you give an indication of how it is you feel when you have been successful? What are the usual needs of the group and what are the services that you provide to meet those needs?

## [May 16, 2002, Special Meditation](en/2002/2002_0516)


> Question: Q’uo, this is a question for T1. The question will be sort of broad and possibly double-based: “I’m interested in the best way to deal with the catalyst in my marriage and how I can be of service and love in that area as opposed to adding to the catalyst and direction for life in general. I feel there is a beating in me that I can touch and feel, and I seem to be doing something with the soul purpose sort of like what I was reading about in The Law of One, Book V, what you had mentioned about ‘silver flecks’; how everyone has their own knowing that they are on the right track. Well, sometimes mine, I guess, may be just a quickening pulse, shivering, you can call flecks at some times. The burning in my lower and upper chest, sometimes, throat. I’m of the mind that this is a ‘use it or lose it’ type of phenomenon, and I don’t want to lose it because I’m not focusing or listening in the right direction to what’s happening. Synchronicities happen all the time in my life, but I don’t know what they mean. I dream and record my dreams many times a week, but I have no idea how to interpret them even though I attempt to. Even trying just sort of confuses me, or they’re more complicated. I know this is a way for God to guide and direct me, anyway. I know there are two big, huge issues or maybe one in the same, basically, about my marriage and the catalyst there; how to learn from it; how to take advantage and learn from the synchronicities in dreams and moments in my life that are filled with soul and direct them into what I should be doing with my life or even spare a love time that I could have to be creative, write, sculpt, etc."

> Group question: The question today has to do with putting the puzzle pieces together, remembering our being, our knowledge, our ancestry, our connection with each other and with the planet. We are hoping that Q’uo can give us some information on how this spiritual journey works for us. No matter how long we’ve been on the journey, no matter how newly we feel revitalized, we need to know how it is that we remember our mission. Are there stages to our remembering? Is there a process that we could accelerate or harmonize with in our daily round of activities? How do we keep that excitement that we all felt at the workshop last weekend alive in our daily round of activities?

> Group question: The question today has to do with opening the heart and the center of love in our daily round of activities. Each of us from time to time has found ways of accessing this energy of compassion. We have insights and prolonged experiences of one kind or another that have let us know that there is an energy there. We would like for Q’uo to let us know how this process of opening the heart is really accomplished by those of us who live here in the third density but still behind the veil of forgetting, still trying to discover the unity with all things. How do we go about opening our heart centers and carrying that love with us into our daily round of activities?

If we wish to be of service and offer ourselves in that way, is there any danger that we could distort the service or make it less than it could be by being proud of our service, by making it public, by doing it in a way that is not hidden, not pure. We would like for Q’uo to talk to us about the optimum way of really being of service to others in a way that does serve other people and doesn’t activate our egos.

It’s hard enough to be honest and to speak clearly to another person about what you are thinking and feeling. We are wondering how a person can also engage the heart so that the intellectual communication that you share isn’t just a means of attacking or defending but that you are also able to engage how you really feel and maybe the higher principles that you believe in, the concept of love and forgiveness and compassion. How would you recommend that people having difficulty communicating—not so much being honest—how would you recommend people be able to get to their hearts, be vulnerable, share what’s really of foremost importance in their lives?
