> Group question: Would you please give us guidance on how to interpret the messages provided by the catalyst we receive in the form of bodily ailments?

> Group question: Some of us are experiencing an internal disharmony in following a calling to withdraw from more active participation in social issues and instead concentrate on our inner spiritual journeys. We recognize the value of doing inner work with less active engagement, but we sometimes perceive an increasing need for active work, sometimes even feeling guilty for not being more involved. Can you speak to this internal struggle and dissonance? What is its role as catalyst, and how can we work with it?

> Group question: Today, we’d like to discuss the nature of relationships formed prior to our incarnation. When we have agreements and lessons planned to learn from specific people, how do we find each other while within incarnation? How are our past lives related to these relationships? And what else can you share about the nature of pre-incarnational relationships?

> Group question: Ra describes their orientation in third density to those spiritually asleep as offering the comforts meant for sleep. While not attempting to simply mimic Ra’s example, this seems like a generally appropriate service-to-others attitude in third density. However, we currently find ourselves in a situation on Earth where those who are asleep could be causing great harm to the planet, potentially leading us all down a path of destruction. Can Q'uo offer suggestions for relating and serving those who seem to be in such a destructive sleep?

> Group question: From love and acceptance to control and manipulation, there is a spectrum of response to catalyst. What about our relationship to the planet? Where on that spectrum does our present global culture lie? What would relationship of love and acceptance toward our planet look like, and how might we more effectively manifest that?

> Group question: Q’uo today our group question is about the shadow side. Could you give us a definition of the shadow side? And then help us to understand how we may understand the shadow within ourselves and how we might balance the shadow side.
