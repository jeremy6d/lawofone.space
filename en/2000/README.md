> Group question: Today we are going to take pot luck, and since it’s close to Christmas and New Year’s, perhaps Q’uo would have a Christmas message for us.

> Group question: When we are trying to make a decision that is important to our spiritual lives, we often have to wait patiently, to take the matter to the heart, and we wonder how we can do this more effectively to gain the direction that we need to follow for our greatest growth? How do we discover what our direction is?

> Group question: The question today has to do with what happens to us when we pass through the doors of death from this illusion to the next, what happens then? Are we able to go on to another location and accomplish other work? If so, what would that be? Do we still have contact with our loved ones and can they become aware of this?

> Group question: The question today has to do with change. Now, in the context of the perfection of the moment where all things are well, we realize that there is change that occurs at all times. And we are wondering as to how this change happens. How much is conscious and how much is subconscious? Is there a balance between change and keeping things the same that is well to maintain? Is there a certain amount of stability that is well in a seeker’s life? How much of the change that is going on can we affect? How much is going to happen whether we have any input or not?

> Group question: The question today has to do with the level of anxiety, and tension, and stress, and rush, and hurry, and angst, that we see all around us in the world today. We see it not only in others, but we see it in ourselves as we go through our daily round of activities. And we wonder if Q’uo could give us some information as to how we can deal with this angst as we deal with other people and as we see it in ourselves. Is there any message that is being delivered when a life is lived in this fashion? Is there anything that we should take from it besides what we see on the surface? We would appreciate anything that Q’uo might have to say.

> Group question: The question today concerns how we can get information from our bodies without having to get a cold, injure ourselves, or in some way bring ourselves bodily grief that is meant to get our attention on a problem we have ignored. We then learn moderation and care for ourselves, but we would like to know how to work with our catalyst without having to learn so much the hard way.

## [September 23, 2000, Homecoming Session](en/2000/2000_0923)


> Group question: The question this evening has to do with the fact that there seem to be changes in the world happening very quickly around us. As seekers, we are wondering if Q’uo could give us some idea as to how we can maintain our balance on our path while changes are happening so quickly around and within us?

## [September 10, 2000, Sunday Meditation](en/2000/2000_0910)


> Group question: Our question today concerns the seasons of awakening. Each person seems to have a time and a way of realizing more of the heart of the nature of the life experience and consciously becomes desirous of learning more of accelerating it, of growing, and really taking things in hand. We would like for Q’uo to speak to us of these seasons of awakening: how we might cooperate with them, foster them, and work with them, not only in ourselves but in other people as well.

## [May 21, 2000, Sunday Meditation](en/2000/2000_0521)


> Group question: Our question today has to do with being of service to others and we would like some guidelines as to when we are actually being of service to others and when we have gone too far and infringed upon an entity’s free will.

## [May 7, 2000, Sunday Meditation](en/2000/2000_0507)


> Group question: Our question today concerns the concept of the emotions. A couple of months ago Q’uo described emotions as the thinking of the deep mind and said something about how we might be able to utilize our emotions in our spiritual evolution, and we would like for Q’uo to elaborate a little bit more on that today.

## [April 16, 2000, Sunday Meditation](en/2000/2000_0416)


> Group question: The question this week has three parts. The first has do with information on what the experience each of us will face as we go through the experience of death will be like. We’ve heard a lot of things said about it, such as there will be guides and friends and teachers there to help orient us to our new environment. We would like Q’uo’s perspective on what this death into life transition will be like. We also would like for you to relate that to the concept of what our entire evolutionary process is like from the third density on. Some writers here in the third density have mentioned the possibility of skipping the fourth density and going directly to the fifth, and we are wondering what Q’uo’s take on that might be? The third part is information on how we can discriminate between positively and negatively oriented entities if a discarnate entity is in our daily lives and the information which we come across there.

> Group question: The question this week has to do with protection. And we are thinking about two types of protection. First, the type that you would invoke from outside of yourself if you felt that there was a need for angelic protection, protection by Jesus, in asking a saint for protection or a guide or any other inner energy you felt was helpful. We would like Q’uo to speak to that type of protection and also relate it to the type of protection that comes from one’s way of living, from focusing on the being, upon service to others. Ra said producing fruit was a protected activity. Would this have anything to do with refusing to be afraid of that from which you might need protection? Does it help to have an attitude of gratitude?

> Group question: The question this week has to do with the discipline of the personality. We wonder what that might mean and how we can utilize it in our daily lives. Does it have more to do with how we respond to the things we do in our daily lives? Does it also include what we do in our daily lives? If, for example, we had six times during the day that we did meditation and prayer would it be a discipline of the personality in the positive sense for us to do these six meditations with a welcoming, relaxed, happy, open attitude, or would we still be exercising disciplines of the personality if we did it grudgingly or if we occasionally forgot? What exactly is the discipline of the personality, and how can we use it in our spiritual life?

> Group question: The question this week has to do with what would be the best way to deal with criticism from another person that really hurts us, that makes us feel real bad, especially when we feel that the criticism is unjustified. As a more specific focus for that general query, we would like information on how to deal with people that are specifically trying to take our power, that we feel drained of energy by after we leave their presence?

## [February 20, 2000, Sunday Meditation](en/2000/2000_0220)


> Group question: The question this week has to do with the concept of guides. We are wondering what is the best way for anyone who wants to get in touch with his or her guide to do that? And we are also wondering, if we are trying to get in touch with our guides and looking at our guides as something outside of ourselves, does that influence or affect our ability to get in touch with our guides? And if we are able to get in touch with our guides, does that add a responsibility to our life pattern?

## [February 6, 2000, Sunday Meditation](en/2000/2000_0206)


> Group question: The question today has to do with the various frustrations and angers, all the various difficulties that come around in our lives periodically and seem to be part of our catalyst. What can Q’uo tell us about what it is possible to do intellectually, logically and consciously in learning from the catalyst, and when it is necessary to do something different, to give it up, to accept the situation, to have faith that everything is as it should be? What can Q’uo tell us about the different approaches, the intellectual, the acceptance, doing something different, giving ourselves a break? How can we know what is best for us to do at any certain time in our life experience?

> Group question: The question this week has to do with the concept of the rapture. Could Q’uo give us information about the process of rapture? Some say that people will go in the rapture without going through the process of death, and we are wondering what Q’uo would have to say about that and what value Q’uo might find in this for our own spiritual journeys.

## [January 2, 2000, Sunday Meditation](en/2000/2000_0102)


> Group question: We have just started a new year and we are wondering, as we look back over the past year, we are wondering what we can learn from intellectually? What can we observe and benefit from? And how much does our intellect play into the growth that we do accomplish? We would also like to know what role gratitude plays in our evolution?
