> Jim: The question this evening has to do with emotions. We recognize love and fear as being polar opposites and we’re wondering if all the other emotions, such as jealousy, anger, doubt, greed, gluttony and so forth are some sort of a mixture of fear with love and if there is positive use that we can make of these supposedly negative emotions. Is there some benefit we can get from working with these emotions? What spiritual principles can we use to look at the various emotions that we come across in our daily lives?

> Group question: Our question this evening, Q’uo, has to do with the seeker, as the seeker attempts to become the magician and change his or her consciousness at will over a period of time in incarnation and maintain the mental, emotional, spiritual and physical balance in so doing. Ra suggested that looking at the path of the seeker as [that of] the magician, it was correct to see it as the ability to create changes in consciousness at will. And this places a burden upon the seeker, upon the magician. We’re guessing that burden is the responsibility to use the increased consciousness in a service-to-others fashion.

## [December 5, 2009, Saturday Channeling Circle - Channeling Circle 3](en/2009/2009_1205)


> Jim: As we seek to know ourselves and know the truth on this journey, there frequently occurs for the seeker an oppositional force, either an entity or an essence, that is of a negative nature. We are wondering how Q’uo would suggest that we attempt to understand this negativity, whether an essence or an entity, and how to address it, how to approach it, how to respond to it.

## [November 28, 2009, Saturday Meditation](en/2009/2009_1128)


> Question from J: (Jim reads.) The question this evening has to do with the process of seeking. As the seeker tries to integrate everything that it is attempting to learn from previous lives and from this life, Ra said the seeker becomes more and more of that which it lives, more and more as it is. And as it is, [it] is the one infinite Creator. We are wondering if, as we become the one Creator, do we give up our identity? Is this something that we will miss as we become the one Creator? And as we live more and more as the Creator, it seems to have more to do with being than with doing. Could Q’uo speak to us about how the seeker progresses along the line of evolution, the upward spiraling line of evolution to become the Creator? What is gained? What is lost? And how is it done?

Would you please speak to us on the most appropriate use of one’s power, in both the protection and defense of the self and in service to others in general, but more specifically as it applies to women who are seeking to live the Law of One?”

## [November 7, 2009, Saturday Channeling Circle - Channeling Circle 2](en/2009/2009_1107)


> Group question: The question this evening has to do with the quality of the seeker who is in need of a certain thing or a person or experience in the life, and then, without any real planning, it seems to come about and their needs are met. We would like to ask about the synchronistic happenings that occur for the seeker of truth. Is there some way we can harmonize with these? Is there some value to these of which we should be aware?

> Jim: M writes, “I was a Navy Seal for 24 years and now have been working as a security contractor for the last six years in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and other hot spots throughout the world. I had an experience where I had the overwhelming sensation to send out the thought of love while in a situation where I intuitively knew my group was going to be attacked by rocket. The attack was thwarted. After that moment, over the next several years, I began to use the thought energy of love in order to thwart many more attacks and keep the groups I was protecting safe. My question is, how can the information about using the thought energy of love be shared with others so that they can contribute to changing the paradigm of war?”

## [October 17, 2009, Saturday Meditation](en/2009/2009_1017)


> Jim: The question this evening, Q’uo, concerns how we become more a part of the life in which we find ourselves. Ra suggested that for a seeker wishing to do this there were three things that were important. One was to know the self. The second was to accept the self. And the third was to become the Creator. Could you briefly touch upon knowing ourselves and accepting ourselves in regards to how we then become the Creator? What does it mean to become the Creator?

## [October 13, 2009, Special Meditation](en/2009/2009_1013)


> Jim: The question tonight is, “Work has been a source of great catalyst to me for the last few years. It seems that since I’ve been at this job, person after person has tried to get me fired. In addition, right after I’d had a big heart-chakra opening last November or December the level of catalyst rose hugely. How much of this is caused by external forces versus self-catalyst and karma? What spiritual principles may I think about in considering this issue?”

## [October 3, 2009, Saturday Channeling Circle - Channeling Circle 1](en/2009/2009_1003)


> Jim: (Reading L’s question.) The question tonight is about the dynamic between actually being of service to others and being able to perceive that we are being in service to others. The example that L gives is of people coming up to her on the street when she has no money to give. She doesn’t know how to be generous when she has no money. She could give them a ring, but they could not take the ring and get what they want, which is a drink. And it disturbs her that she is somehow not being generous. We would like to have any spiritual principles that you could give us to think about in considering the true desire to be completely of service to people and where the rubber hits the road on how you behave in a service to others.

## [September 26, 2009, Saturday Meditation](en/2009/2009_0926)


> Jim: The question from G this evening, Q’uo, is: “We believe it is a common experience among seekers to dramatize and to frame the choices they face in terms of temptation. Does the self create temptations in order to promote and test its growth? If so, does the temptation operate as a means of crystallizing previous learning and moving the entity forward into new learning, the temptation repeating, if not successfully met? Or is temptation simply a means of removing the focus from the heart of the path?”

She would like to ask if there are any suggestions that you might have to make concerning the outer work, the outer catalyst that each of us goes through as we go through our lives, our daily round of activities, and the various types of experiences that we have that provide us catalyst that hopefully we process into experience.

> Group question: The question this evening has to do with what we would call mental imbalances or distortions. They seem to happen more frequently with wanderers. We have received information before concerning the difficulties wanderers and other-home-density vibrations have in blending with this one, but as time goes on it seems like more people here, of any origin, are having difficulty in mentally balancing the beginning change of the vibrations into the fourth density that approaches with the energies of our current culture. Could you give us information concerning why these imbalances occur? Do they occur more often with wanderers? And what are the spiritual principles behind such mental difficulties?

## [May 9, 2009, Saturday Meditation](en/2009/2009_0509)


> Group question: (Asked by Jim.) The question this evening, Q’uo, has to do with the concept of the spiritual seeker. At the beginning of the journey, he feels that it should get easier as it goes on but as he goes on more and more of the journey, it seems as though it gets harder. Maybe that’s the same principle as exercising the muscles—you have to lift heavier weights to get stronger muscles. We’re thinking that perhaps that’s the way it is metaphysically as well. We would like you to speak to this concept, to let us know if indeed it does get harder and if that is why, as we go further along the journey, it seems as though maybe we’re not really getting very far, we haven’t done so much. And does this principle, if it is true, hold true more for wanderers than others? Is it more applicable to those who have come from elsewhere to be of service to those of Planet Earth at this harvest?

> Group question: (Asked by Jim.) The question this evening, Q’uo, is concerning humility. We’d like to know if humility is an automatic manifestation of evolution into higher states of consciousness, or if it is a quality which must be consciously cultivated as one progresses along a spiritual path. Also, in order to enter higher states of consciousness, is humility a necessary prerequisite?

All the way back, each religion seems to have some way of subjugating women so that they are not able to partake in the priesthood, in officiating, giving the rites of the various services to the congregation. I was wondering what it is about the feminine principle that is so threatening to the male. Could you give us some information in that area please?

> Question from L: In the Ra Material there is the use of the slash inbetween words and phrases, for instance, “mind/body/spirit complex,” “time/space” and “space/time.” Two other examples are “light/love” and “love/light.” I understand that with the phrase “mind/body/spirit complex” each of those words indicates a part of the whole. With “time/space” and “space/time” I’m not quite sure about that. I don’t understand the significance of why there are times when the word “time” comes before “space,” or the word “space” comes before “time.” With “light/love” and “love/light” it seems that both of those are parts of the whole or two sides of the same coin and I don’t understand why “light” sometimes appears before “love” and “love” sometimes before “light.” Can you help me with that?

> Group question: The main question has to do with the properties of or place for inner work and outer work and the balancing process. For instance, consider someone with a yellow-ray blockage due to difficulties in his or her relationship in the work environment. I understand that the blockages can be resolved through internal balancing techniques, examining the nature of the difficulty and experiencing appropriate opposing thoughts and feelings to clear up the issue internally. But the blockage also is an inner manifestation of an outer issue between the self and another group of selves that may still need to be addressed to resolve the issue within the third-density experience.

> T: I’m sure you are aware of all the many questions that I’ve brought to you in my many meditations over the last few months. I have some questions here that we have been discussing today and I know you are aware of the many thoughts that I have had and the questions I’ve had during that time.

> Question from D: (Read by Jim.) “I’ve been exploring dream and sleep yoga to accelerate my spiritual development. The idea of dream yoga is to be very lucid and aware within dreams. The idea of sleep yoga is the maintaining of conscious awareness throughout the night, never falling into a deep, unconscious sleep. Although I’ve only just started and I’m not very good at it yet, it has yielded good progress, primarily as a result of my regular middle-of-the-night meditations. What techniques can I apply to facilitate this practice?”

> Group question: (Asked by G.) Q’uo, I have read that Krishnamurti used to say that in the gap between subject and object lies the entire misery of humankind. It seems to me that the spirit’s journey can be seen in terms of the complex and dynamic relationship between subject and object.

> Jim: This is T’s question: “I came across a great book called Cosmos written by Carl Sagan. It describes the intelligence of whales vividly and also describes the cruel behavior of mankind toward them and dolphins. In brief, Sagan says dolphins and whales are telepathic and self-conscious beings and their spiritual level is even higher than that of mankind and that their original homeland is Earth since eons ago.

> Question from G: Q’uo, Newton’s Third Law of Motion states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. In a similar vein, the central theme of the Baghavad Gita consists of a metaphorical battle between the lower, self-serving, sense-enslaved forces of past habits and conditioning versus the higher forces of discrimination, freedom, love and unity.
