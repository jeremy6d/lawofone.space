> Question from J: The first question. Have I missed the point of service to others? My focus is service to all or service to the whole, which includes self. I am uncomfortable with the idea of sacrificing myself for another self but I am willing to sacrifice myself for the whole. Is this keeping me from progressing on the path of service to others? I believe that I have made the grade, that I’ve achieved 51% or higher polarity. Can you confirm? Please comment in any way you feel might be helpful.

> Group question: The question today, Q’uo, has to do with just what language is and how it works. Whether we are communicating with a rock, a tree, with each other, or with a fourth-density entity, how does it work? It is said that Solex Mal is one of the basic languages. Ra said that Hebrew and Sanskrit were very basic languages. What is the basis of language? And after we have communicated, after we have attempted to use words to describe thoughts, feelings, ideas and so forth, how do these thoughts, feelings, ideas and words sink in and have an effect upon us so that we grow, so that we’re more than we were before we heard them?

> Group question: The question today has to do with the kind of problems that we run into in our daily lives that seem to be repeating. After a while they seem to be unsolvable. It looks like the best that you can do is to keep dancing and working with them. We’re wondering if Q’uo has any comment to make that could shed some light on what goes on in a seeker’s life when you run into these problems that may be in relationships and may be with yourself. Is it psychic greeting? Is it something within yourself that wants to show you the dark side so that you can work on it? Could Q’uo comment on these problems that keep recurring in our lives that don’t really seem to go away?

## [October 16, 2005, Sunday Meditation](en/2005/2005_1016)


> Group question: The question today has to do with what I call a dedication to an outcome. When we expend our energy; when we do things, we hope that it will produce a certain result. By dedicating ourselves to this result, we focus our energy. We make it more likely that we will accomplish the result. However, if we happen to fall short, it gives us a reason to doubt ourselves, to be angry at ourselves, to feel unworthy, and so forth. I’m wondering if this dedication to an outcome has anything to do with the creation of the emotions or how the emotions that we feel play into our dedicating ourselves to certain outcomes. Could Q’uo speak to us about that?

> Group question: The question today has to do with the seasons of change that we go through as conscious spiritual seekers on the path. We’re wondering how these might manifest in our lives. We know that there are initiations we go through when times are kind of difficult and we learn specific lessons and if we do learn them then we’re a more advanced neophyte and we’re working our way to adept and pointed towards mastery someday. How do these changes manifest? When we feel blockages or difficulties on the path, is that a part of the process or can we actually make things more difficult for ourselves?

> Group question: The question today, Q’uo, has to do with the fact that so many of us who are here on Earth at this time wishing to be of service to others have found a great deal to do. We live at the speed of computers, jets and commuting. The problem seems to be, for many people, how to get everything done that you want to do. It seems like some things have to be left off! There isn’t enough time in the day for one person to do what that person has set beforehand for herself. How do you go about prioritizing your expenditure of energy in the area of serving other people? Do you listen to your heart that says you give everything you have got to each person that comes your way one at a time? Or do you try to use some wisdom; do you try to tear down, logically, the load that you’ve got so that it’s more manageable? We would appreciate any thoughts that you have in this area of organizing our energies, being of service, and not wearing ourselves out with trying to do everything that’s in front of us.

> Question from V: I have experienced substantial changes in my health and am currently unable to drive long distances or live as I used to do. I feel a huge sadness in these changes, as though I had lost my life. I feel trapped like a mouse in a laboratory maze, unable to break out as my husband does not fly and so I no longer feel free to travel. How can I avoid feeling self-pity? How can I deal with the despair I feel as my doctors find no cure for me? How can I shore up my trust in myself when my memory is faulty and my self-confidence has been completely undermined? How can I come to terms with these changes in my life?

In one way or another, the information moves into different levels of our consciousness and as we come out of meditation and speak with each other afterwards, it seems to get seated in our consciousness in some way.

When in the midst of such a blessing there is no doubt that the true reality overlays this one. My dilemma is how to access that state of consciousness more often, to the point of living in this world. I’m very aware of the massive shifts and changes on the planet and feel them quite intensely, like earthquakes. I’m also experiencing miraculous cellular healing that’s happening to the people with whom I’m working. I’m eager to position my consciousness in that place of receptivity in order to radiate as much as I can. I want to understand more about how the biological interfaces with the higher dimensions.

> Group question: This week, Q’uo, we would like to ask you if you could elaborate upon the pitfalls or distractions that the seeker of truth might run into when the seeking is new and if there is any other type of distraction or pitfall that occurs later on in the path of the seeker. Please give us a general run-down of what to be aware of as one is seeking what is loosely called the truth.

> Group question: The question today has to do with the catastrophe that occurred a week ago this morning in south Asia. Ra has mentioned that during the transition into the fourth density, the Earth would be releasing heat, the pent-up heat of the anger, war and disharmony that has been so prevalent on this planet for most of its recorded history, human history. We’re wondering if this earthquake and tsunami in south Asia is simply a part of that releasing of the heat? Is it a significant event that might signal a certain portion of this releasing of heat is completed? Could Q’uo give us an idea of what the real causes of such a catastrophe might be and what we might expect from our future in relation to further such catastrophes?
