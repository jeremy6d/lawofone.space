> Group question: (Read by Jim.) The question this week, Q’uo, has to do with whether or not it is possible to learn from somebody else’s experience and wisdom through listening, or if real learning only takes place through experiencing what it is you are learning for yourself. Could you speak to this topic, please?

> Group question: (Asked by G.) Q’uo, tonight we would like to ask what the difference is between two basic activities: channeling and becoming. To elaborate further, what is the difference between channeling energy—be that energy the magical personality, radiant awareness, healing energy, inspiration energy, communication energy or love energy—and becoming that energy, becoming the supreme choice of non-dual awareness in which the boundaries between subject and object dissolve so that there is nothing outside of the self to channel and all is seen again as one?

> Question from G: Throughout the Law of One material, Ra speaks often of the entity as a single, indivisible unit. They speak of the entity evolving, the entity doing this thing or that, and the entity making this choice or that choice. Who is the entity that makes choices and is responsible within the incarnation? Is this the conscious self? The subconscious self? Or the undivided whole entity?

While each of you is not channeling we ask that you continue to tune your instrument, sensing into the energy that is moving in a clockwise fashion around the circle and leaning into that clockwise motion of shared energy which strengthens the contact for all of the group.

The question as we quote it is, “There is the phrase, ‘winning over the self,’ which is another way of saying, ‘knowing and accepting the self.’ Is there a similar process that occurs to that of the calling? Do those portions of the self that desire love gain power so that the more the call is made, the more the desire is made until [the] square of the resistance within the self is overcome?

> Group question: The question this evening is about sexual energy exchanges. From the Ra contact we know that two factors which enhance the exchange are extended foreplay, which increases the amount of energy transferred, and both partners dedicating themselves to service to others, which doubles the energy transfer. Also, simultaneous orgasm allows the transfer to be most efficient.

> Question from G: In the meditative state, if an entity concentrated upon sending instructions for desired programming to the subconscious or deeper self, would the deeper self respond in accordance to those instructions? For instance, would the self’s perception of self begin to be transformed if an entity, through concentration in a meditative state, told the self over and over, “I desire to see through the eyes of love”? What kind of power to effect changes do repeated affirmations have? How can one increase the effectiveness of the mantra?

> Group Question: The question tonight is: This planet abounds in a multitude of models, paths and understandings related to the Creator, creation, and the spiritual quest, each susceptible to a wide range of interpretations and most mixed in polarity. There is a vast array of systems of spiritual information that are external to the self, such as the Law of One, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and New Age thought, to name a few, that are printed or communicated in some fashion to the self. In general, what is the ideal relationship between the seeker of truth and information regarding truth which comes from outside the self? How does a seeker situate this information within the self so that it is transparent to the one true authority within and does not become a stumbling block?

> Group question: Our question this evening, Q’uo, has to do with the concept of transformation. On our individual journeys of seeking, each of us goes through various experiences. And we observe these experiences. And I am guessing that when we observe them with the most accuracy, we don’t have judgment for them. We just go through them and let them experience themselves through our lives and in some way or another, cumulatively or individually or at some point, transformations occur. And we would like you to speak to this concept of transformation. How do we come about it? Is there a time within our seeking that is most right for it? Is there a way that we can aid it most effectively? Talk to us about transformation.
