> Group question: The question this afternoon has to do with the so-called mirroring effect, where if you notice a feature, characteristic or behavior of another person that you do not like and you dislike the person for that behavior, what really is happening is that you are disliking some behavior or portion of yourself that is reflected back to you in the other person’s behavior. This could be an indication to you of an area where you have some work to do in acceptance of yourself, and what we are wondering is as you are more and more able to accept yourself for various types of previously unacceptable behavior that you have seen in yourself and in others, do you then begin to see others and the rest of the world and are able to accept yourself and others more easily. But is there a point beyond which you are observing correctly and the behavior is truly repugnant or that which deserves criticism and stands objectively by itself? How does one look at the self with this mirroring effect in mind when determining what is acceptable and what is not? We would appreciate any information that you could give us on this mirroring effect.

> Group question: Realizing that each person comes into an incarnation with sort of a plan of lessons to learn and services to offer, we are wondering if it is possible to do what could be called the “healing of the incarnation,” which would be doing everything that you had planned to do and then going on to “Plan B” since you had accomplished “Plan A.” Is it possible to heal the incarnation to the point that you are able to simple improvise from that point on and put frosting on the cake, shall we say? We would like whatever information you could give us on the healing of the incarnation.

> Group question: The question today has to do with the attitude that might be most helpful when in our daily round of activities we find ourselves in the position of having to change our plans and having to surrender to a new set of circumstances. We wonder if there is a value to this being out of balance, to this learning by trial by fire, if there is a way that we can adjust our perception or responses and our thinking to help this process go more smoothly. Is it helpful if it does that? What can we do to help ourselves in such a situation?

> Group question: We are going to take pot luck on our question this afternoon with the feeling that all of the conversation we’ve had previously concerning how people with 180 degree opposite realities and interpretations from ours in our experience can help us to look within for a direction for our own seeking that is neither too stubbornly consistent with our own thinking in spite of other people’s opinions and which would take other people’s opinions too much into account so that we are constantly changing our course. We would be interested in hearing what Q’uo has to say about this and the other topics that we talked about this afternoon.

> Group question: Our question this afternoon has to do with the situation that so many of us find ourselves in from time to time where we have a disagreement with someone else and even though we give our very best effort at communicating clearly, being compassionate, and of doing everything that we can think of to bring everyone into harmony, these efforts seem to do nothing other than throw kerosene on the fire. It seems like the negativity and hostility seem to have a life of their own. It seems like one can do nothing to affect the situation, and we are wondering if there is something that can be done. Is there an attitude of mind, of heart, of spirit that we can invoke at these times? Is there some deeper lesson or process going on that we don’t really have any idea about? Are we destined to be victims in these situations, or is there something that we can do to bring harmony to the other person, ourselves, and to the situation as a whole?

> Group question: The question today has to do with the concept of pride. We’ve been talking about being honest in relationships and how we behave and how we sometimes build a persona, whether it’s used positively or negatively. It seems to be used in the way we feel like we will get what we want out of a relationship or communication, whether it is a harmonious experience or being honest or maybe telling a little fib and just letting that go. Our pride seems to be the motivating force behind a lot of the things we do and why we do them and we would like some indication as to perhaps the description of pride, how it arises, if it has any beneficial uses, if pride has a balance to it that we can come in contact with in our daily lives.

We would like some information on how we can use the experiences that we feel at those centers in our daily meditations to balance that experience and to help the energy move through in a more normal fashion without distorting it by our own personal wishes.

> Group question: The question this afternoon has to deal with the comparison of the concept of the wanderer, an entity from a more harmonious illusion, moving into this one to be of service to those here, and the Fool, the twenty-second archetype, which walks off the cliff with the eyes covered and with seemingly a lot of danger on all sides, and we would like to know if there is a way that you could compare these two, if they have relationships and if there is some information that might be helpful for us to consider in applying to our daily lives as we wander about and appear to be fools.

Do wanderers have more issues of forgiveness, for example? And perhaps tomorrow, if not today, we would like to know how we can take the energy that we have as a group here, back with us to our homes and continue that work there. We are interested in how we gather our information as individuals and use it, together and at home.

> Group question: The question today has to do with the concepts of anger and sorrow since they seem to be so common to our experience. We’re wondering if there’s any good way of opening ourselves and allowing the processes of anger and sorrow to pass through, to be broken by the experience and to be healed so that afterwards, we are stronger or wiser or more loving or will somehow benefit from having had this experience. Could you talk to us about anger and sorrow?

> Group question: The question this afternoon is from N, and after listening to a lot of our tapes, he says that it looks to him like there are three selves in incarnation: the higher self, the incarnational self and the illusional self, which he describes as basically the genetic material biased by the culture, and he would like to have a discourse on these three selves, and their relationship to each other, and I think we might want to correct the incarnational self and the illusional self as being sort of aspects of the same self, and we might want to add the soul that exists before the incarnation. If Q’uo would like to add any other selves, or subtract, we would be happy to listen, and … that’s it!

> Group question: One way of progressing on the service-to-others path is by biasing our balance and then balancing our biases. These biases are brought to our attention by our perception of events and offer catalyst for processing. Eventually one profits by seeing the Creator in all and radiating love and acceptance in that reality. It appears that the construct of the mind is of such a nature that processing painful catalysts are engraved in the subconscious in a much firmer and more definite fashion than those learned by experiencing joy or happiness. Why did a loving Creator allow the constructs that learn more effectively with pain rather than with joy?

> Group question: The question today has to do with healing. Many of the newer and more holistic means of healing deal with the body that has to be healed, the mind and the emotional system that has an effect upon the body, and then each one attempts to deal also with the spiritual aspect, which has ascendancy over both the emotional and the physical realms. We are wondering how a healer who is using any particular holistic method to heal might aid the patient to engage the spiritual aspect of the healing so that the healing has a better chance of being successful and so that the roots of the problems are dealt with. Could you give us some information on that?

> Group question: A question about relationships this afternoon. We have noticed that people in relationships that seem to have the best time, to stay together the longest, and who enjoy each other the most are people who don’t let the little oddities of their partner’s behavior bother them all that much. Some people can actually get so upset over these little things that they divorce, and I guess that a lot of divorces come from the cumulative experience of a lot of little things that one can’t stand about the other. We are wondering what kind of transformation has to take place within the self for a person to move from where the little oddities in their partner’s behavior no longer bother one, and in fact become a lovable part of the other person’s image, and how does one move from the rejection of another to the acceptance of another and how does this happen within the self?

We experience the catalyst to help us grow. And we’re wondering … beyond the words of small talk, and the intentions and the emotions and the concepts and the way we say things, there seems to be something else of a deeper nature that is communicated when we really communicate. And we’re wondering what it is that is communicated, and how this works through the various forms and means of communication that we use.

How can N get more expansive responses from Q’uo?

The basic statement is that it appears that illness or disease, not chosen pre-incarnationally, are the last resources of evolution for the processing of catalyst during incarnation. This basic imbalance is addressed by the healing modalities in one or both of two ways that depend on the degree of Christ awareness possessed by the one to be healed.
