<p>I am of the principle of Jesus the Christ, and I greet you in the full consciousness of the <em>(inaudible)</em>. We find that that to which we wish to speak this day is of shifting and uncertain energies of confusions in being and loving, and manifesting that being and that loving.</p>
<p>The spirit of love is one and we speak as this instrument calls us, as the living spirit of Christ in the world, and soon we shall yield this instrument to others who speak in a different vocabulary. But do not be confused by vocabulary or entity or name. There is one Father, there is one Love, there is one Kingdom, which is the creation of all there is.</p>
<p>We seek to reassure each of you that confusion is acceptable, if your yearning is kept right and your desire [shining] to know love. Find peace beyond the naming. We leave you in the love and the peace of Jesus the Christ, now and forever. Amen.</p>

<p>I am Laitos, and greet each of you in the love and the light of the infinite Creator. We are pleased to be called to this group to work with each entity in improving those abilities to rest the conscious mind and accept those thoughts which may come from an impersonal source, which has a certain amount of advantage in its longer point of view. We thank each for wishing to be of service as vocal channels for our humble thoughts and we ask each to remember that in the channeling the greatest skill is in the completion of surrender once the contact has been challenged and has passed. In this surrender comes calm and in this calm comes the clear hearing of our thoughts and ease of speaking them into language.</p>
<p>We would use this time as a training session for each channel speaking in a parable which may have some meaning for each. We shall not identify ourselves at each beginning and ending as we intend for this group of channels to speak in fairly short amounts of channel, telling a part of the story that all three weave together. For this is a great lesson in channeling <em>(inaudible)</em> the harmony of the group whether all are channels or only one is a channel creates the unique communication that is brought forth. We remind each channel to relax, to suspend all common sense analysis and self-criticism, and simply flow, once the source of the channeling has been accepted, with the rhythm and the energy that flows so freely betwixt we of the Confederation—we correct this instrument—betwixt those of the Confederation and you.</p>
<p>The sun arose upon a most warm day in a poor desert land. The chatter of the small Spanish village began. The laughter of the small children, the crying of infants, and the calling of the cockerels announced the beginning of another summer day—another day of dust and hunger and stillness.</p>

<p>One particular family greeted this day as it had greeted many before with slow, sleeping sighs of recognition that there was little that could be done in this day that would significantly improve its state of living, for this small village was populated by peasants for the most part, who labored long for small return, that put but the meagerest food upon the table and clothes upon the body. The family was of a relatively young mother and father with two children that were of young school years in age—a boy and a girl—who were learning what it was to live in this village and to help at their young age with the chores of the family.</p>

<p>We are those of Laitos, and would gently interrupt this small tale to admit to the one known as S that this method of teaching the channeling is usually reserved for students who have had several experiences simply in receiving contact. However, we assure the one known as S that this method will, in our opinion, best relax and open the channeling gift which this instrument does indeed have. For in telling the story which no one knows the middle or the end, it is simply a matter of placing one sentence in front of another, as one would walk one foot in front of another. There is no right story. There is no right ending. But only the creation of truth by the surrender of small considerations to the acceptance of a mystery which may or may not uncover more interesting subject matter for thought.</p>
<p>We would again transfer this contact to the one known as S, advising him to release fear, apprehension and analysis, and simply tell his story, as it occurs within the mind. I am Laitos.</p>

<p>For it was their innocence and naive optimism that they imbued their activities and conversations with on a daily basis. These young souls were new in this world of the dust, drudgery and poverty, and yet were amidst the difficulty, filled with the excitement of being alive and enjoying that which was before them as the play toy that would amuse any young child. This enthusiasm was seen by the mother and the father as that which was remembered from their own youth and from which they wished to preserve in the life experience of their children, for they knew well that there was much in years ahead that would work to dampen and even to destroy this kind of vitality which knew no true suffering, for that which brought tears was easily forgotten with the next experience and the joy-filled laughter easily followed the trail of tears.</p>

<p>These two children gazed at the sun bewildered and amazed at its gem-like beauty, brilliance and fire and saw each small desert creature as studded with gems. There was, between these two children, an unusually strong bond and they seldom were apart. One observation of beauty shared by one gave an observation of beauty to be shared back by the other and so in converse did the somewhat harsh Christian teachings of the Spanish padre take on a form and substance which was far beyond those feelings of sorrow, guilt and deadness of <em>(inaudible)</em> which were the emotions of the remainder of the village’s peoples to the stark teachings of the cross and the sacred blood. Yet to these children there came to be a special place, a small depression in the desert land, which seemed to them in their innocence and imagination to be the place where they could speak to the Mother Mary, and so there they spent many hours until their parents began to wonder at their frequent absence.</p>

And as is the way of the world they found they began to <em>(inaudible)</em> circumstances forced them apart and the girl was taken by her new husband for it was the way of the land that girls were married at a young and tender age to a remote area from which it was not consistently possible for her to make contact with her beloved brother. The boy grew to a young man and remained in the town. He frequently visited their sacred spot which increasingly came to mean to him his lost sister, and he never failed to feel her presence there, but it was a feeling mixed with great sorrow for the memory of a … lovely smile is but a pale thing compared to the … experience.</p>

<p class="channel-type">(Jim channeling)</p>
<p>The separation between the girl and boy began to weigh heavily upon each mind and heart for the joy that had been known and shared between these two seemed now greatly diminished and the life that was unfolding before each, though full of its own rewards and pleasures, was quite empty in comparison to that life that was enjoyed by each when together with the other. This deepening concern caused each to reflect in those moments of quietness and solitude as to what the purpose of each life might be for was it not proper to grow in years and experience to become as the parents to others and to bring forth the fruit of life that would nourish all concerned? This pondering in the quiet silence within became for each a solace and a replacement for those times when both had gone to the sacred place in the desert to converse with that spirit that each revered.</p>

<p>As the young man dwelled in mind upon the meanings of the brilliance and beauty he had remembered and seen, the beauty and holiness of his remembered open heart in the presence of the Mother Mary, he turned to the old padre and as the old priest became ill and died, so he became the priest of this place. And because of his ponderings all the harshness and pain of the Christian story became imbued with the poignant love of the Mother Mary and all sorrow was softened by his remembrance of the beloved presence of his sister, and so it came to be that though the cockerels still crowed in the dust and the heat and poverty was the daily bread, the sorrow of life began to be taught to this village in a way which spoke of compassion and love.</p>

<p>Upon telling her sorrow-filled tale to her brother who had by this time in his life heard many such tales, she discovered that the excitement for life that they had once shared in youth now seemed transformed into a quiet, yet sturdy strength that spoke in word and deed of the purpose of sorrow as being that which prepares the way for a peace and a joy which was not as their naive joy had been, yet which drew its strength from that same mysterious source that had given to them so freely in their youth the fullness of the experience of life, for her brother spoke to her of the long vigils that he had kept within himself as he had sought to penetrate the mystery of the daily life that each within this small village experienced with a mixture heavily laden with sorrow and sweat and the little leavened with the joy and inspiration that youth brought to each new child and which the grinding poverty of this area …</p>

<p>This is a simple tale of simple people. Each so among all your densities are such. To each has been given poverty of mind and soul and heart. The enthusiasm and vitality and recognition of beauty that comes from young hearts and eyes, the love of one for another, and all these together make up each of you. Yes, you dwell in sorrow and yes, the cockerel always crows in dusty poverty of some kind. Seldom to those of you who are learning to love is there given a free and unasked for unadulterated joy, vitality and lightness of feeling, yet each of you has been a child. You need not let that beauty die.</p>
<p>Each of you has felt sanctified by whatever name you call it—you need not let that die. Your environment has almost nothing to teach you that cannot also be taught as its opposite. As you poor and hungry in a difficult world awaken yourselves remember the joy, the freshness, the love, the worship, and the presence of the nurturing mother of all things. You choose your inner reality. May you each choose wisely and lovingly and steadfastly the way of love.</p>
<p>We thank each of these channels and are most humbly grateful for this opportunity to work. We realize it has been very difficult and energy consuming for the new instrument and we wish to say to the one known as S that we plunged this instrument into more advanced work simply so as to use the time which we and you are given to its utmost. There is a gift within the instrument known as S which recognizes and has [been] previously used without full awareness of its nature. Thus, we do not begin at the beginning but begin at the level of skill which the instrument has.</p>
<p>We thank especially this new instrument for being willing to open to its best effort and to be willing to skip that which would have, for this instrument, been recreation and not the learning of a discipline and a practice which is also a gift and an art. May this instrument see the power of each word, each nuance with which it clothes the concept given to it. May it see, indeed, its particular and unique abilities that make it an excellent candidate for creating inspiration, information, tools and resources that may aid those who wish to avail themselves of such with the gift of this instrument’s service.</p>
<p>With blessings to all, we leave you at this time in the love and the light of the infinite Creator, encouraging each in daily meditation and contemplation and analysis of those things which have caused the entity distress or great enthusiasm during each day. So that each may know itself deeper and deeper and may come to realize a more profound version of itself and may then have more and more to offer as a channel of love and light. In that love and light, we of Laitos leave you. Adonai, my friends. Adonai. Adonai.</p>
