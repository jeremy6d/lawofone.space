> Hatonn: As you know, we have come to this planet to share with you one simple idea, that is the idea of what has been called the peace which passeth all understanding. It is the original Thought of love that makes all men one.

> Hatonn: We know that there are many questions upon your minds having to do with the great divisions among the peoples of your planet. But what we wish to say to you now has to do with a block which stands in the way of joy and peace on an individual basis. We cannot give peace to nations, my friends, for they will not listen to us. We cannot give joy to a race of men. We can now offer these things only to those individuals who would listen to us. And to you who listen to us tonight, we say that the greatest impediment to joy and peace in your life is a lack of understanding of the true nature of love.

> Hatonn: You must of course dwell within your physical vehicles and cope in such a way with your physical existence, that you do not become a stumbling block before others, nor a liar, nor a [dissembler.] This much attention we must give to our daily habits and duties and responsibilities, and we would never encourage anyone to forgo such indicators of a balanced and stable worker along the path. But we say to you, my friends, that you must be mindful of a certain story which has been written in your holy works, and in that story a teacher, known to you as Jesus, was approached by a young man who asked to become a disciple of the great rabbi.

> Hatonn: We are sure that it has occurred to you, my friends, to ask the same question that has been asked by the one known as David who wrote in your holy works, “Who is man that thou art mindful of him, that thou visiteth him?” Who are you, my friends, and what is your relationship to the Creator? When we can speak to you of the things that are natural in your world, it is so much easier for you to understand your relationship to the Creator. For in your present society, your relationship to the Creator has become very tenuous and very difficult to grasp.

We would like to bring out some points about the reason for the one known to your peoples as Moses being one of your inner guides upon the Earthly plane.

> Latwii: The power of what you might call faith or love is so great that even a small group of people, [can be effective if they] are genuinely concerned and give of themselves in prayer and meditation first of all to seek the truth and secondarily to send love and light to those who are in need and to the planet itself. This energy is extremely powerful and we thank those who have lent themselves to this great work at this time.

> Hatonn: I am Hatonn, and I greet you in the love and the light of the infinite Creator. We, of the Confederation of Planets In the Service of the Infinite Creator, can greet you only with these words, for they describe all that there is, my friend—love and light; for the Creator is love, and it is our understanding that that love, working through motion, or vibration, or, as you may call it, light, has created all that there is in an infinite panoply of beauty and order and unity, so that we are all one divine and unified being, with but one purpose, my friend. And that purpose is to give back that which has been given us so freely.

Yet, we are now here, you and we, and it is with deep appreciation that we join our thoughts to yours in this transient moment.

It has been written in your holy works, “Where your treasure is, there shall your heart be also.” And yet we say to you, my friends, that your heart may contain any treasure which you desire. Thus, the question of treasure is far more the question of your buried desire.

This creature had the body of an alligator but the wisdom of a man. Soon, those about him learned to treat him as a man. And he wore special shoes and special clothing and had a hat specially made for him, and learned to sit upright and eat his meals and hold his job and act in every way like a human would act.

> Hatonn: Once there was a gardener. Year after year he planted his seeds and learned much about his crops, knowing which seeds to plant against which, which crops to move so that the land would not be depleted. He knew the rooting of each tree and of each type of grass, and he began to feel very powerful, for he had often been told that he had the best garden in all of his territory. And one day he was asked how his seeds grew, and he began to explain by taking a seed and separating it into its parts. And as he took his knife and separated the seed and showed his students the functions of each tiny part of this tiny seed, he found that he had killed the seed, for much as he would try he could not put it back together. And so he learned that he was not the originator of the garden but only the caretaker.

> Hatonn: Within this channel’s mind there is a quote from a poet. It goes like this: “April is the cruelest month, breeding lilacs out of the dead ground.” We would like you at this time to ponder those words, for you must take all things personally if you would find their inner meaning. Rather than skimming the surface of the meaning, be shameless and make those things which are general specifically about yourself and see what applies.

In our reality, someone to love and cherish and help and inspire is as necessary to us as is food and drink to you. To us, those whom we have found to be serious students of the path of the Creator are as delicious as your meat and drink is to you, for you are the means whereby we can enlarge our own horizons of understanding; you are the means whereby we can learn more and more about the disciplines and interrelationships of what you may call the genetic personality.

> Latwii: Many of your people do not realize that love is around you and permeates through you at all times. We have used the description of being asleep to describe most of the people of Earth. Some are awakening, although still groggy. Few have awakened totally, but we are with you at this time, my friends, to aid in any way possible your awakening—awakening to the fact that you are, in reality, a much higher being. The physical life as you know it is like a small grain of sand on a beach compared to the total you.

> Latwii: We can take you on a great trip to show you that your thinking is local. You can best understand this concept by considering the love within the creation of man which varies from place to place. As your cycle changes, you have seen the laws of nature, so-called, violated many times by those who are able to use a less-local illusion or reflection of the law of the Creator. Thus, metal is bent, objects are moved, people are healed. We can take you away from your time and your space, and you can see that they are, indeed, not laws at all. We can remove you from mass and show you that that, too, is an illusion and not a law.

> Latwii: There are many among your peoples whose desires we cannot satisfy, or whose desires we do not wish to satisfy, and that is why we have not landed in public places and made ourselves known to you in an unmistakable fashion. But there are many of you who wish precisely what we have to offer, and it is for that reason that we need instruments such as this one to transmit our thoughts to you and to offer you that inspiration that we can and to pour into the circle of your meeting that feeling of love that is our gift to you, the people of Earth.
