> Group question: Today, we’d like to discuss the topic of anger. What is the role of anger on the spiritual seekers path? How can we understand the root causes of our anger? How can we balance this anger and utilize it as catalyst for our spiritual growth?

> Group question: Our question today is about cycles of light and darkness. When we begin entering periods of perceived darkness or destruction and chaos, we have a tendency to reach for the comfort and the light. But is it more appropriate to embrace the darkness and disharmony as a way to accentuate and balance the distortion and allow for transmutation? What is the most beneficial way for us to approach these periods of seeming darkness as [individual] seekers and a culture?

> Group question: Our question today, Q’uo, concerns activism. On one hand, we have statements from Ra like this one from 34.9 where they say:

> Group question: Today we would like to explore the topic of self-worth. Can you elaborate on the role of self-worth on the seeker’s path as well as the obstacle of self-doubt. For instance, what is it we are worthy of, and what does it mean for us to have infinite worth? Any guidance in this area is appreciated.

> Group question: Ra spoke of those of us in third density as parents of that which is in the womb, the Earth or Gaia. They said at that time, in 1981, the delivery was not going smoothly. We relate to Gaia as our mother, providing everything we need in this incarnation, including our bodies. On the other hand, perhaps our individual evolution might be facilitating an easier transition for Gaia to fourth density acting as her mother of sorts. It seems as though there is a polarity one could describe as parent/child and child/parent in respect to our relationship with Gaia, as we experience our relationship with our own children. Would Q’uo speak to this possibility? How is the extreme political polarization we are seeing in our country affecting the delivery of Gaia’s physical fourth density? How can those of us who would like to be of service help with the birth now in 2016, both personally and as a group?

> Group question: Our question today has to do with an individual’s relationship with the Creator. Ra and others from the Confederation speak about the self as the Creator and greater spiritual awareness coming from this realization. However, some of the greatest mystics and spiritual teachers have belonged to spiritual systems which teach about an external objective or even personified version of the Creator. Ra themselves even speak about a yearning between the individual self and the Creator. Is it beneficial or maybe even necessary for spiritual growth within third density to have this objective and external perception of the Creator?

> Group question: There is a paraphrased quote from one of Rumi’s poems that reads: “Live life as if everything is rigged in your favor.” The Confederation seems to echo the same thought in their philosophy, especially with respect to the workings of catalyst. They say that in the earlier phases of the entity’s development catalyst is initially offered to the self by the Logos, but that as the entity becomes more conscious of its evolution, catalyst is eventually created entirely by the self for the self.

> Group question: The Confederation sources stress the importance of seeing the love in the moment, any moment. Can you help us by suggesting approaches or strategies for making a positive identification of love when it's not readily apparent?

> Group question: Spiritual information often suggests that our spiritual growth is a consequence of the suffering we go through and that we should not avoid it by running away, but rather it should be embraced, and we should always try to bolster our faith and patience as a catalyst runs its course, especially as much catalyst as pre-incarnationally chosen. Another school of thought states that our experiences are due to our thinking and feeling and that it is our duty to create better conditions for ourselves. The implication is that if we don’t like an experience, say, poverty, sickness, etc. we can change it by concentrated and focused thinking and feeling. We figure that both positions are probably accurate but there seems to be something of a contradiction between the two, and we would like Q’uo to shed some light on the subject.

> Group question: In our question today, we are looking to learn more about the metaphysical dynamics behind love. Ra mentions love in many contexts, including saying things such as “the great healer of distortions is love” [62.26] and “love is the great protector.” [63.5] We’d like to know, metaphysically speaking, how love can do these things such as protect and heal.

> Group question: As seekers who wish to be of service to others at this time of transition where there are increasing energies and our lives seem to be increasingly busy, often to the point that we feel profoundly overwhelmed, we have difficulty in finding the time and space to work upon ourselves so that we may, in turn, serve others. Can you please help us understand how we may manage in these times to best integrate parts of ourselves and become complete beings in order to offer ourselves in service to others?

> Group question: Our question today comes from N. in Moscow and concerns the relationship between love and wisdom, specifically, can wisdom suppress or impede in some way an opening of the green energy center? On one hand, Ra says that love and wisdom not oppose each other, but rather constitute two sides of the same coin. On the other hand, Ra says that on the negative path, wisdom is a accumulated much earlier than on the positive path.

> Group question: Our question today deals with the idea of pre-incarnative planning and people experiencing the catalyst they need to learn their personal lessons. How can we reconcile the idea that people experience what they need for their personal growth with our desire to serve and relieve other souls of their suffering? Is there a line between allowing people to learn their lessons versus attempting to relieve a person of their suffering?

> Group question: Our question today has to do with the Creator’s will and individual free will. How do we reconcile the idea that we are individual portions of the Creator, imbued with free will when, as crystallized beings of positive polarity, we are said to be performing the Creator’s will?

> Group question: Q’uo, since this contact resumed after a four-year hiatus, we at L&L Research have received questions from readers abroad regarding the transition from third to fourth density that is purported to be occurring now. As you and the Confederation have made a recurring feature of this topic in your message, both in your narrow- and wide-band channelings, we presume that you want spiritual seekers on the ground to know about the density change.

> Group question: In 64.15, Ra said: “In observing the allopathic concept of the body complex as the machine, we may note the symptomology of a societal complex seemingly dedicated to the most intransigent desire for the distortions of distraction, anonymity, and sleep. This is the result rather than the cause of societal thinking upon your plane.”
