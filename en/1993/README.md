> Group question: The question this afternoon has to do with what the Confederation contacts that we speak with think about our continually asking basically the same sorts of question. We seem to need a lot of repetition concerning “being and doing” in our lives, controlling and allowing things to work for their own ends, or, basically, the lessons of love. And we’re wondering how this all looks to the Confederation contacts as they observe our behavior, listen to our questions, and see our concerns—our sort of orbiting in small circles.

> Group question: The question this afternoon has to do with the forgetting process that each of us goes through as we enter an incarnation. Ra has suggested that lessons we learn here with the forgetting process in place carry so much more weight in our total beingness than lessons learned when the forgetting process is not in place—when we remember our total nature and the total unity of all creation. And we’re wondering some about how the forgetting process works, how it is put into place, and then how our remembering takes place and the progress that we make in our lives that’s due to a remembering of the purpose and the goals.

> Group question: The question this afternoon has to do with the concept of spiritual pride as it is balanced with an honest appreciation of your own efforts. We’re all engaged in one kind of big effort, to earn money, to do a life’s work, to complete a certain job or task and we were wondering just how much motivation one can hope for from appreciating your own efforts and where to balance the amount of appreciation with developing it into spiritual pride and being overly pleased with yourself and perhaps complacent and … who knows what else.

Some of you forget that laughter is also a part of the spiritual path. We are asked please to open the shades. Laughter is one of the most effective ways—laughter, joy and lightness, the lightness that comes with deeply sharing your energy and opening your hearts to one another in playfulness.

He would like me to share with you directly the process that I use, which is not with a guided meditation from him. It precedes opening my energy to him. As Carla pointed out this morning, this is simply my own process which I’m sharing with you. I’m not suggesting that you need to use it, just this is how I’ve learned to work with Aaron.

> Q’uo: We were saying that your density of existence is the density of a choice—one great choice upon which so much is based. We were describing this choice as that between radiant service and grasping or magnetic service: service to others and service to self. To discern this choice in each moment is a substantive portion of that learning which you incarnated to pursue. The other part of this learning is simply to continue offering praise and thanks. That is the music which gladdens your walking. The choice made once in full awareness is the beginning. Each choice made thereafter strengthens and deepens the energy which you may usefully accept and allow to move through you. You see, the energy of all things is love.

> Group question: The question this afternoon has to deal with what is sometimes called the spiritual desert-like experience, in which one feels that one is in a wasteland and that the sustenance or the spirit in whatever way it was perceived is no longer present, that one is not connected to, or really partaking in that same experience; a feeling of being isolated and alone, abandoned even. We’ve noticed also that in the rushing through our daily round of activities we can also create something like the desert experience, in which we’re not connected to what we’re doing and we’re passing by so quickly that things and people just seems to be barely marking our days, and we’re wondering if the desert experience has a purpose, if it’s part of a spiritual cycle, and how we can be in that cycle and not be overly concerned about it, and just wondering in general what you might have to say about the spiritual desert experience.

> Group question: The question this afternoon has to do with the effect our constant pursuit of having enough money to survive and pay our bills causes in our spiritual seeking. We were wondering if that basic attitude of our working from 9 to 5 for most of the days of the week has an effect on our spiritual seeking, and we were wondering if there was another attitude that would have a more beneficial effect, keeping in mind that, well, I’ll suggest that the Egyptians began some of their difficulties with disease and famine when they changed from the barter system and the common ownership of all things to private property and the institution of a monetary system. So we would like to know what the effect of our monetary pursuits have on our spiritual seeking and if there is an alternative attitude that may be more beneficial.

> Group question: The question today has to do with how we open ourselves to the awareness of non-dedication to an outcome. When we do anything during a day, whether it’s attempt to apply a spiritual principle to a situation, or earn money, or reflect upon ourselves—anything that we do—we tend to have a yardstick by which we measure the outcome, so that we set ourselves up with expectations for how the things shall be done and the final product that we produce. So, we’re aware that if we can achieve the non-dedication to the outcome—open ourselves to whatever comes through our experience—that things tend to turn out a whole lot better than we could ever imagine. And when we put expectations on outcomes, then we tend to find that our experience isn’t so harmonious, and we tend to judge ourselves. So we would like to know something about how to open ourselves to the awareness of acceptance of any situation and any process that we find ourselves in.

> Group question: The question this afternoon has to do with our spiritual focus, or our spiritual attention span. R was concerned that he was going through his days only occasionally remembering that he was in an illusion and most of the time getting so caught up in work that he was thinking about nothing but the work. When he would get home he would be more able to remember that it was an illusion but wanted to know more how focus could help in his life. Carla was concerned that she was focused on too many projects and energy expenditures and by focusing on too many projects might not be able to do what she wanted to with any one of them, and I was concerned about the focus that a creative person or a skilled artisan of any kind uses in order to bring forth the creativity that is their expression, and also the practical focus of hanging your little toes on the side of the roof so you don’t fall off. So we would like to know something about the spiritual attention span and the focus of our consciousness as we go through our daily round of activities.

In a world of dualities, how is this duality of gain and loss, especially the loss, of help and of a tempering quality, shall we say. How does it aid our spiritual evolution, or how can we use it to aid our spiritual evolution?

> Group question: The question this afternoon has to do with the process of worry and prayer. It seems that when one worries overmuch about a situation, one is really sowing seeds for allowing that situation to take root and to sprout, to grow, to become more likely to be a reality. And the suggestion was made that a form of prayer might be the more helpful of the paths to choose in dealing with a situation that you are quite worried about; that talking out your worry to the Creator, to an angel, to a saint, to your higher self, to whomever, is much more helpful in creating the internal environment that not only gives you a peace of mind and a feeling of perspective, but sows the seeds of greater possibilities, so that that which you are concerned about has more chance of turning out in a favorable fashion rather than in the way which you fear that it might turn out, and the way which you tend to worry about. And we would like Q’uo’s comments on the concepts of worry and its effect upon a situation, and the concept of prayer and its effect upon a situation.

There comes a time in each life when one will experience doubts in their seeking. One might wonder at the path that has been chosen when one struggles with the concept of seeing a brother or a sister who is not quite as one would expect, and still within the self would realize that though there are conflicts, there is still the oneness, the sameness, the reflection of the self in the entity that is causing the conflict.

Number one: when the healer is either attempting to clear his or herself and wishes the energy centers to be the most brilliant and active for the offering of the service of healing, where does the energy flow? Does it flow top down in the energy centers or from the bottom up, and when the healer is attempting to offer itself as a healer, does the energy flow in the same pattern or is it another pattern? Could you tell us how the energy flows in both situations where the healer wishes to purify itself or when the healer wishes to offer itself as a healer?

Is the work we have done as a result of the veil dividing the mind to the conscious and the unconscious work that is useful in our evolutionary process?

And we’re wondering how this new mind could be called upon or used in our daily round of activities to help us process catalyst, make decisions, or simply be in the moment. What is the value of the new mind to each of us as we live our third-density lives?

> Group question: The question today concerns how we get ourselves back in balance when we feel out of sorts, both physically, emotionally and metaphysically. What techniques could we use to regain our center so that we can get a sense of purpose and direction in our lives when we feel there are difficulties, whether it is illness, or money problems, or insecurity about what the next day will bring? What can we do to regain balance, or is it possible to live in a metaphysical balance; is it necessary to be somewhat out of balance to continue making progress? If so, this “angst” as it has been called, is the driving force, but then what is the proper proportion? Is there a need to be concerned in the area, when we are out of balance, is there an action we can take to regain this metaphysical balance?

> Group question: The question this afternoon has to deal with how we can balance our concerns for worldly survival and spiritual perception of the real nature of things; how we can discern what of our concerns deserve our attention and those which perhaps are just a waste of time causing a lot of excess worry. When we have concerns, what kind of a yardstick, or measure, or feeling-tone can we access to determine where we really need to put our attention and our concern?

> Group question: The question today has to do with “If only I had done such and such in a certain situation, in my past, in a situation about which I now feel very badly, it would probably have turned out differently.” We tend, as seekers, to beat ourselves up frequently and badly by this kind of thinking. What we would like today, Q’uo, is perception and perspective on what positive impulse it is in the seeker that causes him or her to say “If only I had done this” or “I should have done that.” Is there some positive quality that we can accentuate, is there some negative or self-defeating quality there that we can be aware of to de-accentuate, and do seekers of truth really have too much to be concerned about in the way of psychic greetings or attacks in this area? How much of our worries of “I should have done that” or “If only I had done this” come from psychic greetings or are most of these of our own creations?

> Question from R and C: How do we know what it is that we need to be doing with our lives and energies in the spiritual senses, and how can we accomplish what it is we are to do? In our hearts we know that we are spirit, but we want to know how the everyday self that lives the life knows what to work on and how to do it.

> Group question: The question this afternoon concerns spiritual pride. We would like to hear some information about the kinds of spiritual pride that both groups and individual seekers could be aware of. From Q’uo’s point of view it is probably easier to spot spiritual pride. We would like to know some of the pitfalls as well of spiritual pride and what a seeker or a group can do to balance the spiritual pride and regain the humility which seems to be such a great ally of the seeker.

> Group question: The question today comes from N, and it is as follows: Q’uo mentioned the aura as the outward manifestation of the form-making body or electronic body perceivable by those aware of their time/space capabilities while in incarnation. It was also mentioned, or at least I understand that the form-maker or electronic body belonged to the inner planes and that the inner planes were in a space/time continuum that has its corresponding realities in time/space existence. Since I believe that the aura is a product of the emanations of the energetic vortices or nexi generally known as chakras, and these organs constitute the etheric body, can I conclude that the ether—not the gas used in anesthesia)—is the synapses between reality and the illusion of the three-dimensional life?

> Group question: Today our question concerns moderation. Carla is concerned as to how she can modify her physical activity to avoid the kinds of injuries that her arthritis has been bringing about through sewing, singing and crocheting and needlepoint and all these heavy physical activities when over-doing in any particular area can bring about an injury. She would like to know what moderation would be in her situation, and R is wondering more generally about moderation in the spiritual seeking, how one can continue persistently and consistently on the spiritual path without becoming overly concerned about the situation that one is in and working so hard to be this or that that is considered ideal that you start working against yourself and start getting frustrated and begin taking your spiritual temperature and judging yourself.

> Group question: Well, the two issues that I have in mind are, first of all, if we can obtain a definition of life that would certainly be applicable to all creation and simple enough to be understood at our level. That is the first question that I had. And the second (it is the simpler one in the group), is why the rainbow colors are sort of upside down, with the purple on the bottom and the red on top. You and I spoke extensively yesterday and today, so you probably know better than I do what else I would like to ask.

> Group question: The question today has to do with the balance one seeks to achieve between accepting what the universe or the life pattern of catalyst has given one in the way of experiences and people, and then balancing that with using these very same situations, the catalyst of a life experience, and manipulating them in such a way as to attempt at least to achieve the goals which we feel are important, the learning of lessons, the loving and acceptance of others and so forth. How do we balance accepting what the Creator and the life pattern has given us and using it to progress along the evolutionary path?

> Aaron: Good morning and my love to you all. I am Aaron. In relation to this focus that Q’uo has offered, there are two areas I would like to bring to your consideration. One is as this instrument has just summarized and the other is to look practically at those places where you get stuck, to look with examples, real life examples, so that you may begin to pinpoint in each of you where distortion arises.

> Group question: Concerning codependency and compassion, “How do I live more lovingly for others and still live with respect for myself?” This question relates to the following statements from Aaron: “You aspire to perfect service and to prayer without ceasing. The being cannot pray without ceasing while it is moored in judgment and confusion. The heart and energy are not open. It can pray without ceasing when it notes the arising of fear and allows fear to be a catalyst to compassion and connection. Heartfelt prayer arises from that connection. Primary is the question of making friends with your own humanness and imperfections in the incarnative state.”

She would also like to know about a book called The Keys of Enoch, and her study of this particular book has been closely linked with her work with Metatron.

> Group question: How much can we either consciously or subconsciously affect the way we look at the experiences in our daily round of activities and what we can do to sow seeds of a wider perspective, a lighter perspective, one that takes the broader view and gives us the opportunity to go through our lives with less turmoil, less of the up and down, or if this is even advisable, is it better for us just to work with the way we go up and down—do people really have an effect upon their attitude or is it a figment of our imagination?
