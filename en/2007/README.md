## [December 29, 2007, Saturday Meditation](en/2007/2007_1229)


> Group question: The question this week has to do with being in the moment. We’re wondering if Q’uo could give us some information about some of the obstacles there are towards keeping us from being in the moment. Our daily lives seem to be full of things that keep us from being in the moment. Please offer some hints as to ways that we can access the moment and be in the moment. And please give us some ideas about what the benefits might be for the spiritual seeker of remaining in the moment and “being here now.”

## [December 15, 2007, Saturday Meditation](en/2007/2007_1215)


> Group question: The question we have today, Q’uo, is about the meaning of Christmas in our world. Please tell us about the spiritual principles involved in living a life that follows in the footsteps of Jesus; specifically, about living from the heart, living in love. And since this is a season of giving, also please mention the principles about giving with love or giving from the heart.

> Jim: The question tonight, Q’uo, is what are the key barriers to and requirements for making contact with intelligent infinity?

## [November 10, 2007, Saturday Meditation](en/2007/2007_1110)


> Group question: (Read by Jim.) The question tonight is: Conspicuously absent in the philosophy of the Ra contact is any mention of the surrender of the conscious self to a guidance, intelligence or will greater than its own, be it the higher self, love and light, or the Creator. Where is there room for God’s grace and surrender in Ra’s philosophy? If surrender is suggested in Ra’s philosophy, to what does an entity surrender?

## [October 27, 2007, Saturday Meditation](en/2007/2007_1027)


> Group question: The question this evening, Q’uo, has to do with the indigo and violet rays. The instrument is about to embark upon writing a chapter in her Law of One 101 book concerning the indigo and violet rays. From the Ra contact we have a good deal of information that describes the various qualities of these rays and the instrument would like to ask you if there are any basic concepts or spiritual principles in relation to these indigo and violet rays about which you could speak that would give her additional insight into these rays as she writes about them.

## [October 13, 2007, Saturday Meditation](en/2007/2007_1013)


> Group question: (Read by Jim.) Our question tonight, Q’uo, has to do with how we, as seekers, can deal with adversity. Our third-density illusion has the purpose, it seems, of providing us catalyst and by using this catalyst we hopefully can grow into greater understanding of our place in the universe and of how to be of service. Sometimes, though, the catalyst is either too much, or we feel like we’re getting burned out, or it’s boringly repetitive and we’re getting tired of doing the work, or for some reason, we just feel discouraged and could use some words of inspiration, something perhaps other than, “Well, remember that you’re all one,” or “Persevere, persevere.”

## [October 6, 2007, Saturday Meditation](en/2007/2007_1006)


> Jim: The question this week comes from our beginning discussion of Stonehenge and its original purpose, thinking that it has something to do with seasons. We were thinking about the seasons of the seeker. Are there seasons in seeking? Most people start out very much on fire and very excited about seeking and read a lot and meditate a lot and do all kinds of things and then it kind of reduces in intensity and the seeking becomes more of a normal kind of thing, a day by day thing.

## [September 22, 2007, Saturday Meditation](en/2007/2007_0922)


> Group question: The question tonight is: Ra says, “Know yourself. Accept yourself. Become the Creator.” We would like to know what is the difference between knowing yourself on the one hand and accepting yourself on the other. Could you define these? Is there any significance in the placement of self-knowledge before self-acceptance in this statement?

## [September 8, 2007, Saturday Meditation](en/2007/2007_0908)


> Group question: The question this week has to do with the role which personality plays in the spiritual development of the seeker. We’d like Q’uo to give us an idea of the best way for the seeker to look at the personality, to use it or not to use it, and how to use it. What role does the personality play in the work of the spiritual seeker?

## [September 2, 2007, Sunday Meditation, Homecoming 2007](en/2007/2007_0902)


> Group question: The question today, Q’uo, has to do with channeling. We have a group of people who would like to learn how to channel in order to be of service to others, starting next year when Carla initiates a channeling circle. They have some concerns about the dangers of channeling, about one’s will being affected by a strong channeling source, and about getting holes in one’s aura. Are there some spiritual principles which you could share with us that would help those who wish to channel to protect themselves and to be of service to others in this endeavor?

> Group question: Q’uo, in light of the theme about our sun that has developed this weekend, we would like to know what our relationship is with our sun and how we as human beings on planet Earth may commune on a deeper level with our sun.

## [August 7, 2007, Special Meditation](en/2007/2007_0807)


> Question from G: Q’uo, within this illusion, even with our most certain of hunches, I feel we are doing guesswork in the darkness. I may be fooling myself, but, based upon my own study, some part of me feels that I am currently knee-deep in that phase, point or portion in the development of mystical consciousness known as The Purgative Way. If this is so, is there anything that I could do to accelerate and successfully complete this stage of the journey so that I can more fully realize that which I desire?

> Question from T: Dear Q’uo, there are many pious teachers and creators in Muslim, Hebrew, Christian traditions who pray night and day in the Palestine region. I believe they all pray for peace and love. Why are there still conflicts and wars raging in Israel and nearby regions?

## [May 20, 2007, Sunday Meditation](en/2007/2007_0520)


> Group question: The question today for Q’uo is from G. It is: “Though I go about every day as if I am seeking the Creator, I am seeking something that is entirely a concept in my mind, something for which I have no reference, something which I have never consciously seen nor ever truly experienced as an incarnate being. How does one seek that which is so invisible and completely unknown to the conscious self?”

> Jim: The first question today from N: “The question is about this new spiritual path that I am on. I would like to know how I got where I am in this place in time, why it took me so long to get here, and where I need to go now to move forward to make the most of things I’m learning and to fully awaken my spirituality to be most useful in service to others and in fulfilling my own spiritual needs.”

## [May 6, 2007, Sunday Meditation](en/2007/2007_0506)


> Group question: The Bhagavad Gita and many other positive spiritual teachings speak of self-control as a beneficial and necessary element of the positive seeker’s path—self-control in the face of temptation and in directing the will for the purpose of spiritual pursuits versus worldly pursuits. Yet Ra offers an alternative understanding in negating control in favor of acceptance and overall balance. Is there a positive use of control? Does control play any useful role in the discipline of the personality? Can one control, for example, through acceptance, meaning that that which has become accepted is able to be controlled or directed?

## [April 22, 2007, Sunday Meditation](en/2007/2007_0422)


> Group question: Our question today has to do with catalyst and how we process our catalyst. We are wondering how we could really test our feelings or know our feelings or know when we have worked successfully, and when we have perhaps worked with it on a surface level and then maybe buried some of it that really needs some more attention, and thinking that we’ve gotten it and then we go on and at some point it seems to come around again and we need to work on it again. So, Q’uo, please give us some direction as to how we can take a look at what’s happening in our lives with our catalyst, so we know when we are working with it successfully and when there’s really more work to be done because we’ve either ignored it or buried it in some fashion.

## [April 14, 2007, Special Meditation](en/2007/2007_0414)


> Jim: The first question from T is: “What exactly is the time lateral of Earth? Does it indicate an illusion within a more real illusion? Or is it like the holo-deck on Star Trek’s fictional world? Then are all the stars and planets except Earth all holograms because Earth is in the time lateral? Or, on the other end, if there was no such thing as a time lateral in the beginning, what would the third-density Earth be like?”

## [April 8, 2007, Sunday Meditation](en/2007/2007_0408)


> Question from D: I feel as though something is out of order as far as time and the perception of time. The days don’t feel like they are supposed to be. It is as if something is out of sync. We are wondering if Q’uo could give us any information about the energies that affect our illusion at this time. Is there any particular reason why people who are sensitive to such things might be feeling that there is something not quite right with the way we are perceiving time; with the way time is being experienced in our illusion? Are there any spiritual principles here that Q’uo could speak to that might help us understand this situation?

In discussing these principles, I have found it helpful to offer them as information helpful to playing the ‘Game of Life.’ It is a sacred game yet it is definitely a game.

## [February 18, 2007, Sunday Meditation](en/2007/2007_0218)


> Group question: The question this week has to do with the various religions that we have on planet Earth. They all seem to have a center of truth, but each religion also seems to have a number of adherents who interpret it their own way and who become fanatic in one way or another, trying make the religion into a dogma, to say this is the way and the only way. Is this a human trait? And how can we really know what is the true path for each of us? It seems like each of us has that spark of the Creator in us that recognizes truth and we are more reminded of truth than informed of truth. Can Q’uo give us some general principles as to how look at the various religions and how to find what is “the way” for us?

## [February 11, 2007, Sunday Meditation](en/2007/2007_0211)


> Group question: Our question this week, Q’uo, is: Each year, for many years now, we see at least one channeled source that says, “This is the year that the big changes will happen in consciousness.” Some now say that 2007 is when this age will change instead of having to wait for the year 2012. We want to know what spiritual principles could help us look at this situation when channels get this kind of information.

> Group question: Q’uo, today the question concerns the study we’ve been doing for the past weekend on the archetypical mind. These are concepts that are very intellectually challenging and we would like to know, as we go back to our daily round of activities and our normal lives, how best to apply these concepts in our daily lives. How can we attempt to use them to better open our hearts and to understand the Creator and each other and ourselves? What’s really happening in our space/time environment, our daily lives, and what’s happening in the metaphysical realms, in the spiritual realms, as we attempt to apply these principles to catalyst and circumstance that comes our way?

His intentions were pure to serve and save his friend but his actions were mixed. We would like to ask Q’uo how our polarity is affected when our intentions are good but our actions are mixed.

## [January 7, 2007, Sunday Meditation](en/2007/2007_0107)


> Group question: The question today, Q’uo, has to do with how the seeker that desires to be of service affects both the service and him or herself by either doubting the service, doubting the self, or feeling a little bit too good about it, like maybe he or she did a really good thing. How does the attitude of the one who seeks to serve affect the server and the service?
