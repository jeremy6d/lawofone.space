> Group question: We’re talking about grace and where it might come from: the Holy Spirit, the Creator, the intelligent energy that enters through our feet and base chakras, to guides, spiritual teachers, etc. And we are wondering if the expression of grace is some means of communication from the metaphysical life that we live to the physical life that we live? Is this a way by which we are given a gift? Is this something that is with us always? Is it with us only at particular moments? How can we interpret the experiences of grace that come our way? Is there any way to use grace consciously in our spiritual lives? Is there a way of responding to it appropriately, or is it something that we are simply caught up in?

> Aaron: We have been speaking of different aspects of the devotional life. We come to a large aspect, which is ego’s desire to blame. Somehow this that recognizes itself as entity may have experienced pain or felt a sense of humiliation or experienced a heavy emotion. Any of these arisings are uncomfortable and make ego squirm.

> Aaron: I hope you have had a restful night. A few of you are aware of dreams in which you were observant of the movement between contraction and opposition to it, and to dancing with that catalyst and the resultant contraction about which we spoke last night. We have been talking about this balance between the ultimate being—which is whole and knows its wholeness, which experiences no veil separating itself from the reality of its wholeness—and the relative being which perceives itself to be less than whole and is struggling to become whole.

> Q’uo: We are blending our vibrations with yours; and as we weave our way through the ribbons of your thoughts we sense the energy of birth and transformation within each who sits in this circle of seeking. Each seeker sincerely wishes nothing more than to find truth in the self, in the environment, in the thoughts, and in each other. Each has a burden that is carried at some cost, and each has a yearning that cries within and yet is deeper than tears can express: to love, to be loved, and to be of true service.

> Group question: Our question today deals with the foundation self that we attempt to know, to build a path to, to solidify with faith throughout our lives. It seems that catalyst either peels away layers of our being so that we get closer to this foundation self or an adding unto the various experiences and personalities that we have so that we approximate this ideal or core self, whether it is faith or soul essence that comes with us from incarnation to incarnation. We would like information about how we work to know this core of self, how we balance various aspects of this self that seem at odds with each other, how we get to know mysterious parts of this self that make themselves known from time to time, how we find messages from that core self in our dreams that come in archetypical images.

> Group question: We have been talking about two concepts, the preincarnative programming that allows us to learn the lessons we have chosen and the free will of the incarnation that blends with the supposed predestination of the preincarnative choices. The other question concerns the blending of the planet’s religions, cultures and philosophies and we wonder how these can be reconciled to achieve peace. We would like Q’uo’s comments on whatever seems to be of value to our evolution in these areas.

> Group question: We were talking about changes that occur through synchronistic events. Is there a way to prepare oneself for such synchronistic events or is one wildly and wonderfully taken by it and at its mercy when it comes? And the other thing we were talking about was how our growth seems to be enhanced when we gather together in groups, whether just to talk or to meditate or worship, and we are wondering how that works, its value, etc.

> Group question: The question this afternoon concerns the topic discussed this afternoon. Many religions and philosophies have as one of the basic tenets the dropping of all desires, because the desire is seen as that which ties us to this world, and if we wish to transcend this world and go to the next, better world, or a better state of mind, then we need to drop the desires that are tying us here.

Is there any way of being of service to others other than by providing catalyst that could be provided to that person almost in any way. That person is going to go through that catalyst with or without us. So, what is our role other than working on ourselves?

> Group question: The question today has to do with our darker sides, the part that is unknown (inaudible) is mysterious, sometimes it’s perceived to be fearful or destructive or angry or in doubt or full of jealousy or rage or whatever. We are wondering whatever you can tell us about the darker side, how it functions, how we can shed light on it, if there is a way of becoming friends with and understanding what we see as the darker side. Is there another way of perceiving it, does it have a purpose that it plays in our spiritual evolution and how can we go about accepting ourselves and the darker side as a part of our overall growth?

We are all feeling rather inspired and inspirited, we [would] like to have some information upon this general concept of resurrection or rebirth, the coming into being of a new self, the inspiration bringing a new being, a risen being, more inspired and full of light. And we would like to have whatever information you could give us on how this process happens in our own lives, how it happens in the world around us, the interrelationship between the two and anything that you could say on rebirth or resurrection.

> Group question: The question this afternoon has to do with sexuality. We would like to know a number of things about sexuality, Q’uo. We would like to know what the natural expression of both the male and the female sexuality is—what are the archetypical images or forces that aid or cause this expression to be as it is? And we would like to know how it is most appropriate for us to work with or handle, to perceive these sexual energies in ourselves and in each other. And we would like to know if there is a way in which sexual energy exchanges can be used to experience the unity of the creation and the Creator. Is there a pathway there for evolution? And is the intelligent energy that is the creative force in the universe the same in us as sexual energy, or does it set this sexual energy in motion within us?

> Group question: Our question this evening has to do with absolute reality and relative or personal reality. We are wondering if it is possible for a person to transmit his/her reality to another person or if it is even wise to try to do so? Is it possible for us to transcend our personality, to take part in the ever-changing nature of the way we perceive the universe about us? Is there a value in this? Is there any way that we can know with some degree of certainty that what we are dealing with is true or real? And what is Q’uo’s preferred perspective on reality and truth?

The differences can be sex, race, color, length of hair, creed, dressing, ideas one has in one’s head, and we would like to know if this is an innate quality of humans, mammals, animals in general or whatever.

> Group question: The question this week has to do with the “Who am I?” question that each seeker asks. We are wondering about the incarnational personality as a focus as to who each seeker might be. The incarnational personality, of course, has connections with the soul identity that has been through many incarnations and has connections with the one Creator as a portion of that Creator. We are wondering if you could tell us something about the incarnational self, who that self is, and use it as a vehicle for evolution.

## [January 29, 1995, Sunday Meditation](en/1995/1995_0129)


> Group question: The question this week comes from N and has to do with the concepts of service and love. It is his observation that the basis of all creation is to serve, one portion of the Creator serving another, and that the substance of the creation is love, everything is made out of love, the creative energy of the Creator. Now, N feels in our daily lives that service is more obvious and instinctual. We are able to recognize our opportunities to serve as they come about. We just see what needs to be done and do it. Love, however, seems to be of the nature of that which needs to be worked on. It takes will or an effort to do it and we are never really sure of how well we are doing it. Whereas with service we are aware of what we have done and can at least be sure that something was accomplished. In loving, it is not so obvious, and we would like Q’uo’s comments upon N’s observations.

> Group question: The question this afternoon has to do with the incarnation into various races and cultures on this planet. We are wondering if people tend to incarnate into only one race or culture and move as a unit or group within that race or culture and maintain their identities from incarnation to incarnation as members of a particular race or culture or tribe, or if people are more likely to incarnate across racial or cultural boundaries and have a multitude of different types of experiences, and if this experience is what the soul experiences. Does the soul experience many different kinds of racial, tribal or cultural incarnations, or does the soul have identification with particular races or cultures?
