# welcome to the lawofone.space

## updates

+ May 14, 2018 -- Initial release

## notes

+ Please note that this site is a work-in-progress.

### things that are not working

+ Footnotes are non-functioning inside a transcript
+ Search has been added, but please note that this is currently a stop-gap. 
  + Search is slow, (near unusuable on mobile devices) and only searches transcript descriptions.
  + In the future, full text of all transcripts will be indexed with lunr.js and it should be quite snappy

### todo

+ convert the corpus to markdown
  + this will add titles, links, better formatting to the transcript page
  + fix footnotes
+ implement auto-update for when new transcripts are posted to L/L Research
  + lots of devops stuff
+ implement offline capability with dexie or pouchdb
+ implement full-text search on the corpus
  + using lunr
  + jump to result
+ implement related pages using NLP
+ add more content from L/L Research
  + Books, etc
  + older (unofficial) transcripts
