## updates

+ May 14, 2018 -- Initial release

## notes

+ Please note that this site is a work-in-progress.

### things that are not working

+ Footnotes are non-functioning inside a transcript
+ Search has been added, but please note that this is currently a stop-gap. 
  + Search is slow, (near unusuable on mobile devices) and only searches transcript descriptions.
  + In the future, full text of all transcripts will be indexed with lunr.js and it should be quite snappy
